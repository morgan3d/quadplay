                  **FIND WORD ALLL NITE FAQ**

How do I load the game?
: **Go to https://tracewords.com** on a phone, computer, console, etc. for the ideal full-screen
  experience.

  You can play however you like, but the game **plays best on a phone in portrait orientation** because selections are faster with a finger than
  a mouse or gamepad or keyboard.
  
  On iPhone, you can get back more screen area for the game by [hiding the Safari toolbar](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iphb3100d149/ios#:~:text=Change%20the%20display%20controls%20for,Safari%20app%20on%20your%20iPhone.&text=%2C%20then%20tap%20Hide%20Toolbar%20(tap,Show%20Reader%20(if%20available).
  
  If you have quadplay console, you can also run quadplay
  in kiosk mode and load FWAN from there, but it will be scaled to the quadplay emulator
  window. The game is part of the quadplay open source distribution.
  
  If you don't like that domain for some reason and trust itch.io or github more, then you can also 
  play from https://shmuel797.itch.io/find-word or https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/games/find_word.


How do I play?
: Touch screen/mobile: drag your finger over letters to connect them in to a word.
  Repeat until the timer runs out. Press the curved arrow button
  on screen to rotate the board.
  
  Mouse: use the mouse to drag over letters. Press the curved arrow button
  on screen to rotate the board.
  
  Gamepad: use the D-pad or stick to move over a letter. Press the primary button (such as A or X)
  to select. Move the cursor and keep going. Press the secondary button (such as Y) to cancel.
  Use the right shoulder button to rotate.
  
  Keyboard: use WASD or the arrow keys to move the cursor. Use SPACE to select,
  ENTER or H to cancel, and RIGHT SHIFT or G to rotate the board.

What is the scoring method?
: The sum of the points of the letters, with a multiplier for length. See the table below.
 

How do I earn XP and level up?
: Play in Global mode. Your level, XP, and new abilities are saved after the leaderboard
  screen when the *_next_* match starts. Solo mode is for a calmer
  practice experience.

What if the game server is offline or overloaded?
: The server can't go down because there isn't a server. The app is
  fully distributed and peer-to-peer.

Can I play in Global mode and earn XP if I am offline?
: Yes, if you have already loaded the page and don't reload. Your stats
  and XP are stored on your phone or computer. If you reload then obviously
  you won't be able to load the webpage for the game.
  
Can I play _with other people_ if I'm offline?
: Yes. Everyone in the world sees the same board at the same time even
  if they are offline. So, you can play at the same time as someone else and discuss 
  matches even without internet access. For example, two friends in a log cabin off grid can play next
  to each other on different phones and then compare scores.

What's the deal with Moo and the other bots?
: Keep leveling up to find out.

Is the game done? How do I get the latest version?
: New features are coming out all of the time. It's currently in open
  beta. Everything is backwards compatible, so your progress will be preserved
  when you hit reload on your browser to upgrade to the latest version.
  Expect new high level abilities and achievements, and narrative changes
  to be the main improvements going forward.

Why isn't there an app?
: Dealing with app stores sucks time and energy, and their licensing rules make it 
  almost impossible for an open source game to exist. So I don't deal with that
  and just make the game free online.

How do I move my progress to another computer or phone?
: 1. Press the ⚙ gear button
  at the upper-left of the screen
  
  2. Select "Export Save Game". It will make a `.savegame`
     file in Downloads or Files
  
  3. Copy the file to the new computer or phone
  
  4. On the new computer, press the ⚙ gear button and select "Import Save Game"

Beta? What if it crashes? How do I back up my progress?
: Export a save game as above and just keep it safe on your computer.

Are the high scorers hacking?
: Probably not. It is possible but slightly difficult to hack the game. Some people
  are really good. But as you play more you will both personally learn some strategies
  by looking at other people's words *and* you will unlock new in-game abilities that
  grant score and XP freees.
  
But, but...what they did seems impossible!
: High level players gain powers that you can only begin to imagine at lower levels.
  These powers are hard to use effectively, but players who have practiced and 
  mastered them can do seemingly impossible things. I promise these aren't overpowered
  and it depends on skill, not grinding or abusing the powers. You'll get there, too.

Why doesn't it show definitions? Or pronuciation? That would be educational!
: Yes. I'm sorry we can't do that right now. I'm trying to source a high quality,
  reliable open source dictionary and work out how to make this function in game.
  For now, you definitely should take mystery words and look them up on your own!

What about accessiblity?
: The game supports touch screen, trackpad, mouse, keyboard, and various game
  controllers. It will automatically switch between those. Because
  of the nature of the game it is unfortunately impractical to add
  support for people with vision impairment. The game is designed
  to work well for different kinds of color vision and with hearing
  impairment.

What about other languages than English?
: English happens to work really well for word games because it has
  a ridiculous number of words (there are about 190k in this game's dictionary),
  a relatively small alphabet, and 
  an incredibly liberal spelling grammar due to borrowing words from
  many sources. It is 
  _possible_ to make word games in other languages. But, unfortunately,
  the gameplay is just not as interesting as in English.

Who made this game?
: Press the gear icon and select Credits to see the full credits for all 
  of the creative commons assets used. Briefly: the
  game is by [sʜᴍᴜᴇʟ](https://shmuel797.itch.io/). It is built on the [quadplay game engine](https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/) by Casual Effects
  and friends.
  Harpy is the community manager for quadplay and the games in the quadplay distro.
