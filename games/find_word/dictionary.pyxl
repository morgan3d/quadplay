/*
 Routines for working with words, including
 the dictionary word sets.
 
 The dictionary contains about 193k words that are not proper nouns,
 including variations such as plurals.
 
 The full boggle board contains about 57M possible 
 sequences (nodes in the search tree).
 
 In this game:
 
 - "word" as a variable name means an all-caps, Q-encoded word (Q = Qu)
 - "text" as a variable name is something that can be shown to the player
 - In-game text representing a dictionary play word is shown in all caps
 - In-game letter tiles are capital letters, except for "Qu" 
 - All other text is mixed case, except for: logos, avatar names,
   and the Free Mode animation
 - The primary emphasis color is HIGHLIGHT_COLOR pink
 - The primary button/cursor/UI selection color is green
