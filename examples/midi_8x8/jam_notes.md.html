    <br>**_A game jam where you touch 64 big juicy pixels!_**


This jam is powered by a quadplay✜ in a web browser, connected to a
8x8 RGB USB MIDI grid controller. The [`midi_8x8_lib.pyxl`](../../scripts/midi_8x8_lib.pyxl) API
abstracts the quadplay✜ MIDI API to map all 8x8 controllers
to a common API, and supports emulation on phones and tablets.

# Required

- Must use 8x8 RGB LED touch grid for both input and display
- Must run in a web browser
- Must be playable on machines that have only a MIDI controller, speakers, and computer keyboard
- Must support the following physical I/O devices to the same level provided by `midi_8x8_lib.pyxl`:
   - Novation Launchpad Pro MK3
   - Novation Launchpad X
   - Novation Launchpad Mini MK3
   - Akai APC Mini mk2
   - Ableton Push 1
   - Ableton Push 2
   - Ableton Push 3
   - LinnStrument 128
   
# Encouraged

- Make gameplay primarily use the device touch input and output plus computer audio, with the computer screen used mainly for instructions or emulation on touch screens instead of gameplay
- Support emulation on screen, for players with tablets and phones instead of without physical MIDI devices. device_visualize() and device_send_output() simplify emulation.
- Provide a single player mode
- Explore directions other than freeform music synthesis

# Permitted

- You may use other tools than quadplay✜ and other APIs than
  `midi_8x8_lib.pyxl`. However, they are the easy way to satisfy the
  requirements, and the goal of this jam is supporting quadplay✜!
- You may use additional I/O devices (gamepads, mouse, keyboard, other
  MIDI) so long as the game also uses an 8x8 RGB LED MIDI
  controller. Embracing the limitations and possibilities of the 8x8
  grid is the best way to fulfill the theme of the jam.
- You may support additional features of a particular device (e.g.,
  knobs, additional lights, note velocity, MPE) so long as the game is
  playable without them.


# Q&A

Q. _How do I get one of these wild physical controllers for the full experience?_

A. They're common at music stores and online retailers. Rent, or buy
used equipment for a steep discount at places like Reverb​, Sweetwater​,
and L&M​. For new devices, the [Akai APC mini mk2](https://www.akaipro.com/apc-mini-mk2) and 
[Novation Launchpad Mini MK3](https://us.novationmusic.com/products/launchpad-mini-mk3) are the most
affordable ones at US$100 or less each.



Q. _Can I participate without a MIDI device?_

A. Yes! The API includes one-function support for emulation using
touch screen, mouse, game controller, or computer keyboard. You can
make games using these, and will be able to play any game that
supports the touch screen emulation API.



Q. _What is the API?_

A. It couldn't be simpler: a 2D array of input buttons and output
pixel colors. There are optional functions for automating emulation
and common graphics tasks.


Q. _How do I get quadplay✜?_

A. It is free on github, with install scripts, bundled assets, and an
easy-to-use Python like programming language.
