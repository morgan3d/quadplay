2019 May 1: Public API Preview
=======================================


2019 March 20: Renamed to Quadplay
=======================================

After NVIDIA announced the Jetson Nano product, the
"nano JAMMER 2" console is renamed to avoid confusion.

I selected name "quadplay" with public and alpha-developer
input.


2018 July 1: Private Alpha
=======================================

Testing begins with an experienced set of retro coder and PICO8
developers.

2018 December 1: Scaling
=======================================

Forked and began scaling nano JAMMER up from a Tweet-jam console to
a full game jam and education fantasy console.

See the original [nano JAMMER](https://morgan3d.github.io/nano/doc/specification.md.html#changelog)
change log for public development on the early parts of this project,
and the [codeheart.js](https://casual-effects.com/codeheart/) project
from which the nano JAMMER codebase originally forked.
