Quick Start
====================================================================================

Welcome to the quadplay✜ public beta!

To get started you only need:

- [The quadplay✜ development kit](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay/archive/master.zip)
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
- A modern web browser ([_Chrome_](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [_Firefox_](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [_Edge_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), or _Safari_)

For the quadplay✜ development kit, just download, unzip, and then copy
the files wherever you would like on your computer. There is no
installer or configuration required.

To make a game, run the `quadplay` script at the command line. When it
opens your browser, select the "Tools" menu from inside the quadplay
development environment and then the "New Game" option. Look at the
Built-In Games section for more examples.

If you've worked with other scripting languages, then you may want to
read the PICO-8 section, Python section, or JavaScript section of this
document for some starting tips. 

If you're new to programming, just look at the many sample games and
examples that are included and try modifying your own copies of them.

!!! Info Pro Developers
    Experienced programmers can use external editors with quadplay✜ for both
    programming and directly modifying game and asset `.json` files by:
    <ul>
      <li>Optionally [clone the SDK with git](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay) to manage SDK upgrades</li>
      <li>Install a code editor (_[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), Vim, Emacs, etc._)</li>
      <li>Install the PyxlScript extension for your editor: _[Visual Studio Code](#advancedtools/visualstudiocode)_, _[Vim](#advancedTools/vim)_, _[Emacs](#advancedtools/emacs)_</li>
      <li>Put your games under `~/my_quadplay/`. The IDE always creates new games in the root of that path, but
          you can reoganize it to form a hierarchy to group games or manage different games
          using different version control repositories. </li>
    </ul>


Launch your program in the emulator and debugger from the command line
on Windows CMD, macOS Terminal, or a Linux terminal with the `quadplay`
command in the root of the SDK. Here are some examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
# Run the emulator and IDE. You can use Open Game from the Tools
# menu to load games
quadplay

# Load the games/quadpaddle/quadpaddle.game.json sample program
quadplay quad://games/quadpaddle

# Load the space.game.json game that you've made (on Mac and Linux)
quadplay ~/my_quadplay/space

# Load the space.game.json game that you've made (on Windows)
quadplay C:\Users\MYNAME\my_quadplay\space

# Load your game and allow mobile clients to connect by scanning
# the QR code displayed in the IDE (Mac and Linux)
quadplay --host ~/my_quadplay/space

# ... Windows
quadplay --host C:\Users\MYNAME\my_quadplay\space

# Load a game from the web (their server must support CORS)
quadplay https://morgan3d.github.io/somegame/foo.game.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These examples assume that your directory structure is:

*****************************************************************************
*   📂 HOME (~/ on Mac and Linux, %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% on Windows)
*   |
*   +-- 📂 my_quadplay
*   |   |
*   |   '-- 📂 space
*   |       |
*   |       +-- 📄 space.game.json
*   |       |
*   ⋮       ⋮
*
*   📂 quadplay
*   |
*   +-- 📄 quadplay
*   |
*   +-- 📂 fonts
*   |   |
*   |   ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 games
*   |   |
*   |   +-- 📂 quadpaddle
*   |   |   |
*   |   |   +-- 📄 quadpaddle.game.json
*   |   |   |
*   |   ⋮   ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 sprites
*   |   |
*   ⋮   ⋮
*****************************************************************************
[Directory structure with the `quadplay` script in the root.]

The directory and `.game.json` file do not have to have the same
name. You can list the full path to the actual game file instead.

Your games do not have to be stored in a subdirectory of the SDK.
They can be anywhere on your system.

Every time you push the Run button (F5) or Reload button (Ctrl+R) in
the emulator within the web browser, it will reload your code and
assets from disk.

You can use the built-in assets from the developer kit, existing ones
from sites like [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org) and
[FreeSound](http://freesound.org), or create your own using:

- PNG pixel art editor for sprites and fonts (_[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), [AseSprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), Photoshop, GraphicsGale, etc._)
- MP3 sound tools (_[BFXR](https://www.bfxr.net/), [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), etc._)
- TMX map tool ([Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/))

_People playing your game don't need Python, just a web browser. See the Deploying Games section for more information._


Workflow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should create your programs however works best for you. Here's how
I like to work in quadplay✜:

1. I start with a project file to load standard assets from `quad://`
   and a single *mode* called `Play.pyxl` that has no sections. I write a
   little code to draw the game.

2. Pretty soon, I need some state that persists between frames, so I separate
   `Play.pyxl` into top level initialization code and a `frame` *section*. I then declare variables
   in in the top level of the mode, and as my main loop grows too long, I start to define helper
   functions there as well.

3. At some point, I'm ready for *another mode*. This is usually for
   gameplay reasons, and not polish, because it is still early in the project.
   This might be a map or inventory screen, for example. As soon as there
   is a new mode, I need to have variables that can be seen by both modes.
   So, I also create a `common.pyxl` file or other *script* to store the global
   variables. I continue this process as more modes are required, periodically
   checking the mode system diagram in the IDE to ensure that the game
   flow is what I expected.

4. As code starts to become duplicated in the modes, I move generally
   useful helper functions out to scripts. When the scripts themselves
   get long, I start grouping them by functionality. For example, `particle.pyxl`,
   `animation.pyxl`, and `hud.pyxl`.

This is a workflow that is good for prototyping, especially in game
jam and hobby projects. I feel like keeping everything as simple as
possible and then refactoring at growth points is best for
productivity.

Otherwise, it is hard to iterate in the beginning because you're stuck
with big program abstractions in what is still a small program. Many
prototypes don't go the distance to become big programs,
anyway. There's no reason to overdesign early on.

Programming Model
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **PyxlScript** programming language is designed to make compact,
readable games. It blends Python, Lua, and JavaScript
syntax. Indentation and newlines signify blocks and ends of
statements. The syntax is based on math notation and looks like
pseudocode. Variables are explicitly declared and dynamically
typed. There's lexical scope, first class functions, and literal
expressions for objects and (zero-based) arrays. It is decidedly
function-based instead of object-oriented.

Most of PyxlScript programming is typical of any imperative,
high-level language. It is similar to Python, Lua, JavaScript, C#,
and Java.

There are three special parts of the PyxlScript programming model that
are designed to simplify programming arcade games. These special
features are [*modes*](#modes), [*2.5D graphics*](#2.5dgraphics), and [*frame hooks*](#framehooks).


### Modes

Your program consists of one or more *modes* which are game states that the
player will experience. Common modes are "Play", "Pause", "Title", "Inventory", "CutScene", and "GameOver". Use `set_mode()` to change which mode the program is in.
Clicking on the "Modes" label on the left side of the IDE draws
a diagram showing the modes and transitions for your program.

![Mode diagram for the Quadpaddle sample game, as shown in the IDE.](modes.png width=50% style="image-rendering:auto")

For each mode, you specify what code runs every *frame*. This is the
body of the inner loop. Modes have capitalized names and are defined
in a script file with the same name. The simplest implementation of a
mode is just this per-frame code.

The `mode_frames` variable tracks the number of frames since this mode started.
`set_mode()` changes the mode and leaves a note in the debugging output explaining
why the mode changed. It is also used by the IDE to visualize the state machine
of your program and label the transitions, as in the diagram above.
`get_mode()` returns the current mode, which acts like a special constant.

You can also separate the mode file into different sections:

- Top level: runs once when the game is first started. Usually just variable and function declarations.
- `enter`: event that runs when this mode becomes active by another executing `push_mode()` or `set_mode()`. `enter` may be followed by an argument list
   that will be filled with the values passed to `set_mode()` or `push_mode()`.
- `frame`: event that runs every frame while this mode is active. Put your drawing and simulation code here.
- `leave`: event that runs when the game changes to another mode by executing `pop_mode()` or `set_mode()` itself.
- `pop_mode`: event that runs when the game returns to this mode from another by `pop_mode()`.

Note that `leave` and `pop_mode` do not run on `reset_game()` or `quit_game()`. 

You can think of these as callbacks, although they are not regular
functions and can only be invoked directly by the console.
You may be familiar with the concept of a [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine),
also called a finite automata or flow chart. Your program is a state machine with the modes as the states.

!!! Note: Transition Hints
    The IDE automatically constructs the mode diagram from your program. It is
    [impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem) to
    do this for all programs, but it can usually do a good job. When
    the automatic algorithm misses a link, you can give it a hint
    using a commented out `set_mode()` call in your mode file.  For
    example, <code style="white-space: nowrap">// set_mode(GameOver) because "0 lives"</code>
    will add a link from the current mode to the `GameOver` mode.

The syntax of a mode with multiple sections is similar to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format:

1. The name of the mode on the first line
2. A line of `=`, `═`, or `⚌` characters to underline the mode name
3. The top-level code
4. The sections, each with a name underlined by `-`, `-`, `─`, `—`, `━`, or `⎯` characters

If you're accustomed to object-oriented languages, then you might
think of the whole program as:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Java
public class Menu extends Mode {
   // These variables are the top-level code
   protected int selection;

   public void enter(int value) {
      selection = 0;
      play_sound(menuOpen);
   }

   public void frame() {
      selection = (selection + gamepad.y + 3) % 3; }
      drawChoices(selection);
      if (gamepad.a) {
         if (selection == 0) { set_mode(play); } ...
      }
   }

   public void pop_mode(boolean confirmed, Mode from) {
      if (from == confirmDialog) { ... }
   }

   public void leave() {
      play_sound(menuClose);
   }
}

Mode menu = new Menu();

...
menu.enter();
while (get_mode() == menu) { menu.frame(); }
menu.leave();
...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[This is the rough equivalent of the menu mode PyxlScript code in an object-oriented language. You don't write all of this boilerplate in PyxlScript!]


#### Unmatched Push and Pop Mode

Push and pop on modes aren't always paired, because sometimes an exceptional
change to state flow occurs. 

*********************************************************************
*   .-----.   push_mode(B)   .-----.   set_mode(C)   .-----.
*  (   A   )--------------->(   B   )-------------->(   C   )
*   '-----'                  '-----'                 '-----'
*********************************************************************
[Actual code executed with unmatched push/pop mode calls.]
 

For example, if mode `A` executes `push_mode(B)`, and then
`B` executes `set_mode(C)` (instead of popping), the order of events triggered will be:

1. `B: enter` 
2. `B: leave` 
3. `A: pop_mode from B` 
4. `C: enter` 

This is as if `B` had run the `pop_mode` and then `A` directly
transitioned to C.

*********************************************************************
*             push_mode(B)                  
*   .-----.----------------->.--+--.                 .-----.
*  (   A   )                (   B   )               (   C   )
*   '--+--'<-----------------'-----'                 '-----'
*      |       pop_mode()                               ^
*      |                                                |
*       '----------------------------------------------'
*                          set_mode(C)
*********************************************************************
[Equivalent behavior triggered by the actual code, so that PyxlScript can ensure matched push/pop]


### 2.5D Graphics

Graphics in PyxlScript are similar to other 2D rendering APIs. You can
set the background color, draw basic shapes and text, and render
sprites with some features such as flipping and rotation.  There's
special support for drawing whole tile maps as well.  All drawing
commands support an [_alpha_ channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing) for transparency.

What is special about the 2.5D graphics in PyxlScript is that each
drawing command has an associated _z-order_. If two commands are at the same z-order,
then whichever comes second will draw on top of the other one. Commands that have explicit,
different z-order values will render from low to high values.

This means that you can issue drawing commands in whatever order is
convenient and let the rendering system organize them as you wish.
It also makes it easy to render orthographic games such as [_Double Dragon_]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dragon_(video_game)"),
isometric games such as [_Populous_]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(video_game)"), and other games with semi-3D effects. The included
[_Speed Street_](#playable) game demonstrates this.

Although the screen is cleared to the background color every frame,
all of the drawing commands are stored for one previous frame.
This allows dialogue and pause screens to re-render the previous
mode's last frame using `draw_previous_mode()` so that they can
render on top of them. This rendering retains z-order, so you can
even inject new graphics in between objects from a previous mode's
frozen image.


### Frame Hooks

In addition to the mode's frame code, you can dynamically register
hook functions to run at the beginning of every frame using
`add_frame_hook()`. These are useful for timers and animations. For
example, you can use this to draw an explosion every frame until it
dissipates or to shake the screen for three frames.

Frame hooks can be tied to only run in a specific mode or to run in
all modes. You can also specify a separate hook to run each frame
from the one to run when it expires.

The closest relative to frame hooks is JavaScript's `setTimeout()`
function, although it is much more limited.



Coming from...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some tips to get you started quickly when you're coming to
PyxlScript from other popular programming languages.

### PICO-8

If you're used to programming in PICO-8 Lua, make these changes for the
PyxlScript:

- Create a *mode* for your project.
  - Put your top-level and `_init` code into the top level
  - Put your `_update` and `_draw` combined into the `frame` section
- Declare variables with `let` and `const` instead of `local`
- Variable names can't begin with an underscore
- Arrays start at 0
- Use `size(x)` instead of `#x`
- Use `:` between the beginning of a block and its body
- Blocks have no `end` statements and indentation is significant
- Use `:` within object literals instead of `=`
- It is safe to mutate containers inside iterator loops
- You must specify a font for `draw_text()`. Several are provided; see the Fonts section.
- Enjoy the overloaded operators, array functions, z-order, and alpha blend


### Python

The PyxlScript language feels a lot like Python, with these changes:

- Comments begin with `//` instead of `#`
- Explicitly declare variables with `let` and `const`
- Use `size(x)` instead of `len(x)`
- Use `debug_print` instead of `print`
- Use `for low <= i < high` instead of `for i in range(low, high)`
- Variable names can't begin with an underscore
- The `==` operator is pointer equality (Python `is`). Use `equivalent` for object structural equality tests.
- Variables have block scope instead of function scope
- Function variables have lexical scope (no `global` statement required)
- No integer division (use `floor`)
- It is safe to mutate containers inside iterator loops
- No comparison operator chaining, except on `for` loop definition
- Use `keys(obj)` and `values(obj)` instead of `obj.keys()` and `obj.values()` (although you almost never need either)
- Use `extend(a, b)` for Python `objA.update(objB)` and `listA.extend(listB)`
- Use `concatenate(a, b)` for Python `listA + listB` and `{**objA, **objB}`
- Use `x = if t then a else b` for Python `x = a if t else b`
- Use `true`, `false`, `nil` instead of `True`, `False`, `None`
- Use `def foo(a, b, ...rest)` instead of `def foo(a, b, *rest)`
- Use `foo(a, b, ...rest)` instead of `foo(a, b, *rest)`


### JavaScript

The PyxlScript language feels a lot like JavaScript strict mode, with these changes:

- Use PyxlScript `==` in place of JavaScript `===`
- Use `:` and indentation instead of `{}` for defining blocks
- Use `def` instead of `function`
- Variable names can't begin with an underscore
- No `;` required, except for multiple statements on the same line
- Use `size(x)` instead of `x.length`
- Use `for k in object:` instead of `for (k in object)`
- Use `for v in array:` instead of `for (v of array)`
- It is safe to mutate containers inside iterator loops
- There are no anonymous functions
- Function names are not lifted to the containing function's scope
- Use `x = if t then a else b` for JavaScript `x = t ? a : b`
- Use `debug_print` instead of `console.log`
- Enjoy the overloaded operators for vectors



Tools
====================================================================================

Development Environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The browser development environment supports several alternative
layouts, which are selected from the buttons on the upper right of the
screen.

I expect most experienced programmers to use external editors such as
Visual Studio Code and Photoshop and put the development environment in 
Full Screen or Test layout. Most newer programmers will
directly use the built-in integrated development environment within
the browser in the Develop and Debug modes.


![](../console/ui-fullscreen.png width=32) Full Screen
: Play your game full screen. Good for playtesting.

![](../console/ui-touchscreen.png width=32) Touch Screen
: Play your game with single-player mobile touch controls.

![](../console/ui-test.png width=32) Test
: Run with a large emulator and the debugger visible. This is 
  good for using on the left or right half of the screen when 
  running an external editor on the other half.
  
![](../console/ui-debug.png width=32) Debug
: Pixel-doubled emulator and compressed text editor. Good for
  debugging graphics code and tuning constants.
  
![](../console/ui-develop.png width=32) Develop
: 1:1 pixel emulator with text editor and debugger. Good for
  working on gameplay code.
  
![](../console/ui-edit.png width=32) Edit
: Full-screen code editor. Good for writing lots of code.

![](../console/ui-ghost.png width=32) Ghost
: Show-off mode for livestreaming, with the full screen code
  editor and the game running behind it full screen, like a
  ghost. Press the Play button to switch input to the game
  in the background. Game touch input is obviously not available
  in this layout.


There's also a special "kiosk" mode that the `quadplay` script
can run in for removing the top control bar when running on
an arcade machine or other public display mode.


Emulator
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main tool is the console emulator, which you can launch with the
`quadplay` command at the command line.

The emulator accepts keyboard and game controller input, as well as
directly pressing its buttons on screen for mobile. On a gamepad, you
must press a button before directional input will register in a web
browser.

Pressing the "Play" button on the editor automatically transfers keyboard focus to the emulator.

The emulator has special keyboard keys for:

- F5: run
- F6: screenshot
- F8 or Ctrl+G: start/stop recording GIF [^safariGIF]
- F10: step one frame
- Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C
- Ctrl+R or Ctrl+F5: reload

On macOS, either Control or Command can be used for "Ctrl".

[^safariGIF]: On Safari, you have to explicitly allow popups for the website for this to work.
 Go to Preferences --> Websites --> Pop-up Windows and check "allow" for `localhost` (or whatever
 address you access quadplay✜ from).


### Controls

quadplay✜ presents virtual controllers for four players. You can use
the on-screen buttons on mobile and touch screens for a single player, a
keyboard for up to two players, and connect most USB or Bluetooth game
controllers for up to four players. Physical controllers work on all operating
systems and mobile devices.

For two-player keyboard input, you can use two USB or Bluetooth
keyboards on the same computer, or have both players share a single
keyboard.

8BitDo controllers work in wired, wireless, and
[XPad](https://support.8bitdo.com/xpad.html) mode. They seem most reliable on Windows and Linux.
Be sure to install the latest firmware update from the 8BitDo website.

Left and right Joy-Cons work individually in horizontal mode. They cannot be joined as on
Switch. The Switch Pro controller and the SNES and NES controllers work normally.

On macOS, Xbox wired controllers require a free,
[open source driver](https://github.com/d235j/360Controller-n). Xbox wireless controllers
do not work on Mac. Different controllers work with different browsers on macOS. For example,
Xbox 360 controllers work well with Chrome and the Nintendo SNES controller works with Safari.

PlayStation, Stadia, and [Logitech](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/products/gamepads/f310-gamepad.html) controllers
as well as various fightstick arcade controllers are intended to work but I have not tested them.
Please let me know if you are using them successfully.

All browsers have controller support, but Chrome seems to support the
most different controllers and the rumble feature.

[Sample controller mappings. quadplay✜ supports many more, including JoyCons and flight sticks.]

After launching a quadplay game, you must press a button on the
controller for the web browser to allow access to it. quadplay will
automatically detect the controller and change to appropriate button
prompts for most standard devices, including Xbox, PlayStation,
Switch, Stadia, and Thrustmaster controllers. If your device is not
mapped correctly, just enter the pause menu on any game and select
"Set Controls".

I've found that the easiest Bluetooth controller to pair on macOS is a
Switch JoyCon.  Turn on Bluetooth on your Mac and open the Bluetooth
preferences. Hold the controller horizontally and hold the tiny sync
button
[you have to take off the black wrist strap holder temporarily to access this button]. You'll
see the controller appear on your Mac.  Click on its name and select
"connect". When you want to re-pair the controller with your Switch,
just slide it back onto the Switch and it will sync.

8BitDo controllers seem to work very reliably on Windows and Linux
but are inconsistent on macOS.

The [X-Arcade](https://shop.xgaming.com/) controllers work with quadplay.
On Windows with a recent (2020 or later, or with the Tri-Mode PCB upgrade) X-Arcade controller,
set XInput Mode 4 with the switch on the back. The mapping is below. For 
other operating systems or older controllers, use keyboard mode and program
the buttons to match the quadplay keyboard controls.

![On Windows, put your X-Arcade in X-input mode 4 and it will automatically provide this mapping.](xarcade-mapping.png style="border:none; image-rendering:auto" width=50%)

![When using an X-Arcade controller in keyboard mode 2, program it like this.](xarcade-keyboard.png style="border:none; image-rendering:auto" width=50%)

Other ten-button arcade fightsticks have two common button layouts. The
symmetric ECDF layout used by inexpensive Honcam and PXN sticks puts the
"shoulder" buttons that correspond to ⓔ and ⓕ on the left and right of
the other "face" buttons. The CDEF layout used by more expensive Mayflash,
Hori, eTokki, Qanba, and other sticks puts the "shoulder" buttons to
the right of the "face" buttons. The appropriate button prompts will
appear in quadplay for each one, but you'll have to change which fingers
you use to play games depending on the physical layout.

#### Dual Stick, etc.

When using a dual-stick console controller, the unused parts
of player 1's _physical_ controller are mapped as alternate controls
for the player 2 (`gamepad_array[1]`) _virtual_ controller. This makes it easy
to test two-player games using a single controller.  It also allows
for single-player games with dual-stick controls using either both
halves of the keyboard or controller 1. For example, using an Xbox 360 controller:

Physical Controller      | Quadplay Input
-------------------------|-------------------
Left Stick/D-Pad         | `gamepad_array[0].xy`
Right Stick              | `gamepad_array[1].xy`
A                        | `gamepad_array[0].a`
B                        | `gamepad_array[0].b`
X                        | `gamepad_array[0].c`
Y                        | `gamepad_array[0].d`
R1 (Right Shoulder)      | `gamepad_array[0].e`
R2 (Right Trigger)       | `gamepad_array[1].a`
L1 (Left Shoulder)       | `gamepad_array[0].f`
L2 (Left Trigger)        | `gamepad_array[1].b`
Start                    | (`gamepad_array[0].p`)
Back                     | `gamepad_array[0].q`
R3 (Right Stick Press)   | Not mapped
L3 (Left Stick Press)    | Not mapped


### Analog Sticks

Quadplay exposes system features beyond the standard quadplay
capabilities using the `device_control("get_analog_axes", stick_index)` function for low-level
system access.

You can read analog sticks, steering wheels, foot pedals, flight
sticks, etc. directly using this API. Games that use these features
will not work on all quadplay devices. But, it is a great way to
program for a specific platform that you have in mind or have built.


### Resolution

The emulator screen tries to maintain an integer multiple of the
native pixel resolution to prevent distortion of pixel art. When
running on a very high resolution screen (greater than 2.5x), it
relaxes this constraint to use the full screen effectively.

As a result, the emulator is pixel-perfect on small displays and fills
the screen on large ones. Quadplay supports the following resolutions,
all with 4:4:4:4 RGBA color and 60 Hz refresh:

- 384x224
- 192x112
- 128x128
- 64x64

For reference when importing assets or designing games inspired by
previous work, here are the resolutions of classic and retro machines:

 - 480×272 PlayStation Portable
 - 400x240 Playdate
 - 384x224 quadplay✜
 - 320x200 VGA, including Amiga 500 and Commodore 64
 - 280x192 Apple II
 - 256x240 NES and TurboGrafx-16
 - 256x192 Nintendo DS and Sega Master System
 - 256x224 SNES
 - 240x160 Game Boy Advance
 - 240x136 TIC-80
 - 160x192 Atari 2600
 - 160x144 Game Boy Color and Sega Game Gear
 - 160x102 Atari Lynx
 - 128x128 Pico 8



quantize✜
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[quantize✜](../tools/quantize.html) is a standalone browser tool for
converting any image format that your browser can load into a sRGB8 PNG
for quadplay✜. While the console emulator can load any PNG file, if you convert
them using quantize✜ you will have control over the color reduction process
and be able to produce much smaller files for distribution.


fontgen✜
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[fontgen✜](../tools/fontgen.html) is a standalone browser tool for
producing rough quadplay✜ font images from fonts installed on your local
computer. You can then screen capture these and edit them in your
favorite pixel editor to clean them up.


fontpack✜
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[fontpack✜](../tools/fontpack.html) is a standalone browser tool for
taking a font PNG file with regular tiles (such as the one produced by
fontgen✜) and packing it tightly. It will generate the output PNG
and the `.font.json` file for you.


scalepix✜

[scalepix✜](../tools/scalepix.html) is a standalone browser tool for
upscaling a font or sprit PNG file to twice the resolution in each
dimension, for upscaling existing assets or importing
NES, PICO8, and Game Boy assets.



Standard Library
=========================================================

Standard library functions are first-class values. They can be stored
in data structures and variables.

A parameter shown with parentheses and an equal sign after it, for
example: `i (= 0)` indicates that this is an optional parameter and
the value in parentheses will be used if none is supplied. Explicitly
specifying `nil` for any parameter forces its default value.

Input
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Gamepads

The gamepad objects in the four-element `gamepad_array` each have
the following properties:

Property           | Values   | Meaning
-------------------|----------|----------------------------------
`index`            | 0,1,2,3  | Index of this gamepad in `pad` array
`x`                | -1,0,+1  | Current D-pad value on the _x_-axis (+1 = right)
`xx`               | -1,0,+1  | Direction that was just pressed this frame on the _x_-axis
`dx`               | -2 to +2 | Change in direction this frame on the _x_-axis
`y`                | -1,0,+1  | Current D-pad value on the _y_-axis (+1 = backward)
`yy`               | -1,0,+1  | Direction that was just pressed this frame on the _y_-axis
`dy`               | -2 to +2 | Change in direction this frame on the _y_-axis
`xy`               | xy       | `xy(x, y)` for the gamepad
`dxy`              | xy       | `xy(dx, dy)` for the gamepad
`angle`            | -π to +π | `rotation_sign() * atan(y, x)` if both are not zero, otherwise the last angle
`dangle`           | -π to +π | Change in `angle` this frame
`a`                | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓐ button is currently pressed
`aa` or `pressed_a`| 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓐ button was just pressed this frame
`released_a`       | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓐ button was just released this frame
`b`                | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓑ button is currently pressed
`bb` or `pressed_b`| 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓑ button was just pressed this frame
`released_b`       | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓑ button was just released this frame
`c`                | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓒ button is currently pressed
`cc` or `pressed_c`| 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓒ button was just pressed this frame
`released_c`       | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓒ button was just released this frame
`d`                | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓓ button is currently pressed
`dd` or `pressed_d`| 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓓ button was just pressed this frame
`released_d`       | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓓ button was just released this frame
`e`                | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓔ button is currently pressed
`ee` or `pressed_e`| 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓔ button was just pressed this frame
`released_e`       | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓔ button was just released this frame
`f`                | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓕ button is currently pressed
`ff` or `pressed_e`| 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓕ button was just pressed this frame
`released_f`       | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓕ button was just released this frame
`q`                | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓠ button is currently pressed
`qq` or `pressed_q`| 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓠ button was just pressed this frame
`released_q`       | 0 or 1   | 1 if the ⓠ button was just released this frame
`prompt`           | `{...}`  | An object mapping button names to text prompts (see below)

The axes are affected by the current transformation _at the time that
they are read by your program_, as set by `set_transform()`. Reading the same property twice
with a transform change in between can change the sign of the value. The
angles are always clockwise in screen space.


`any_button_press(gamepad_or_touch (= ∅))`
: Returns true if any button on `gamepad_or_touch` was just pressed.
  If `gamepad_or_touch` is `nil`, returns true if any button on any
  gamepad was pressed or there was any touch.

`joy`
: A variable equal to `gamepad_array[0]` as shorthand for
  single-person games.

`gamepad_array[]`
: The array of all gamepads. Regardless of how many physical controllers are
  connected, there are always four elements.

### Button Prompts

The `prompt` property of a `gamepad_array[]` value is to be used with `replace()` to
create strings for showing controls and button prompts to players with
`draw_text()`.  It maps `"ⓐ"`, `"ⓑ"`, `"ⓒ"`, `"ⓓ"`, `"ⓔ"`,`"ⓕ"`, `"ⓟ"`, `"ⓠ"`,
`"⍐"`, `"⍗"`, `"⍇"`, and `"⍈"` as well as ASCII aliases `"(a)"`,
`"(b)"`, `"(c)"`, `"(d)"`, `"(e)"`, `"(f)"`,`"(p)"`, `"(q")`, `"[^]"`, `"[v]"`,
`'[&lt;]"`, and `"[&gt;]"` to strings of text. These can be used to describe
controls to players in a way mapped to the physical controller they
are currently using instead of the quadplay✜ native controls

For example, `replace("Press (a) to jump", gamepad_array[0].prompt)` creates a
string with the proper physical button label for the first player's
primary button substituted for the string `"(a)"`. On a PlayStation
controller, this string will be `"Press ⓧ to jump"`. On an Xbox
controller, it will be `"Press ⓐ to jump"`.  For a player using the
keyboard, it will be `"Press ␣ to jump"`. The value of `gamepad_array[].prompt`
can change during the game if the player uses the system menu to change
the control scheme, so you should always generate the string right
before drawing it instead of at program start.

The `gamepad_array[i].type` property describes the control scheme used for
prompts.


### Touch

quadplay✜ provides single-touch and single-button mouse input via
virtual touch screen. Not all quadplay✜ devices support touch input
(although most do, through a touch screen, stylus, or
mouse). If there is no mouse, then `touch.a` is always `false`.

`touch`
: There is a single `touch` global object with the following properties:

Property                 | Type     | Meaning
-------------------------|----------|----------------------------------
`touch.x`                | number   | Camera-space x position
`touch.y`                | number   | Camera-space y position
`touch.dx`               | number   | Change in `x` since the previous frame
`touch.dy`               | number   | Change in `y` since the previous frame
`touch.xy`               | xy       | `xy(touch.x, touch.y)`
`touch.dxy`              | xy       | `xy(touch.dx, touch.dy)`
`touch.a`                | boolean  | True if the touch is currently active
`touch.pressed_a`        | boolean  | Was the touch started this frame?
`touch.aa`               | boolean  | Same as `pressed_a`
`touch.released_a`       | boolean  | Was the touch ended this frame?
<!-- `touch.screen_x`      | number   | Screen-space x position
`touch.screen_y`           | number   | Screen-space y position
`touch.screen_dx`          | number   | Change in `screen_x` since the previous frame
`touch.screen_dy`          | number   | Change in `screen_y` since the previous frame
`touch.screen_xy`          | xy       | `xy(touch.screen_x, touch.screen_y)` for the touch
`touch.screen_dxy`         | xy       | `xy(touch.screen_dx, touch.screen_dy)` for the touch -->

The `x` and `y` values are in camera-space coordinates using the current transform.
Change or reset the transform to read them in a different coordinate system, or use
the transformation routines.

If there is no active touch, then the coordinates reflect the previous
active touch location.  There is no way to track a hovering mouse or
detect a scroll wheel or second mouse button with `touch`, which would not be
mapped to a mobile device anyway. `device_control()` allows low-level access to
additional device-specific pointer properties.

<!-- The `screen_x` and `screen_y` use (0, 0) as the top left of the emulator screen. -->


### Main Menu

The system pause menu is bound to the ⓟ button, which is not visible to games.
Games can add up to three custom elements on the pause menu, and can change these
at any point.

`set_pause_menu(opt1 (= ∅), opt2 (= ∅), opt3 (= ∅))`
: Override the custom elements on the pause menu. Each argument
  is an object of the form `{text:string, callback:function, confirm:boolean}`.
  At 64x64 resolution, specifying `opt3` disables the automatic game
  credits option in the pause menu.

  - `text` is the menu item text. It will be clipped if too long.
  - `callback` is a function of no arguments to execute when this option is selected.
  - `confirm` (defaults to `false`) if true, is an additional confirmation dialog
    appears when this option is selected.


Modes
------------------------------------------------------------------------


`get_previous_mode()`
: Return the previous mode, or `nil` if there was no previous
  mode. When returning to a mode via `pop_mode()`, the previous mode
  is the mode from which _that_ one was entered; they are on a stack.

`get_mode()`
: Return the current mode. This can be passed to hook functions or
  compared against mode names, but not to `set_mode`, which requires an
  explicit mode name. during mode initialization, `get_mode()` returns `nil`.

`launch_game(url)`
: Load a different game. This is primarily used by the built-in
  quadplay✜ launcher, but is available to all programs. This may be
  removed in version 1.0.

`pop_mode()`
: Go back to the previous mode that invoked `push_mode`, restoring the
  draw calls and `mode_frames` as of that point. It is a runtime error
  to invoke `pop_mode()` when the mode was not entered from
  `push_mode()`. Invokes the `leave` section of the current mode but
  not the `enter` section of the mode being returned to.

`push_mode(Mode, ...)`
: Enter a new mode but remember the current mode. Combines their draw calls
  for `draw_previous_mode()`. Useful for modal dialogs, such as pause screens,
  inventory screens, and dialogue. Does not invoke the `leave` section of
  the current mode. Does invoke the `enter` section of the mode being entered.
  Any arguments after the `Mode` are passed to the `enter` section.

`quit_game()`
: Quit the game and exit to the IDE or the launcher. Note that games do not
  form a stack. Quitting a game returns to the built-in quadplay✜ launcher or
  IDE, and not the game that launched it.

`reset_game()`
: Reset the game, restoring all assets and starting again from the
  initial mode.

`set_mode(Mode, ...)`
: Immediately switch to the new mode. The current mode stops executing and the new
  mode begins.

  The mode name must be the literal name of the mode, not a variable,
  a value from a data structure, or the return value of the function.

  If the note is present, it must likewise be a string literal and not
  an expression.  The note is a comment that is used by the IDE for
  creating state machine diagrams and in the IDE for debugging. It has
  no effect on the executing program.

  Erases the `push_mode` stack but remembers its draw calls.
  Any arguments after the `Mode` are passed to the `enter` section.

When changing modes via `set_mode()`, the order of operations is:

1. `get_previous_mode()` switches to the current mode,
   `get_mode()` switches to the _new_ mode.
2. The _previous_ mode's graphics commands are captured for future
   `draw_previous_mode()` calls.
3. Any `leave` code executes on the _previous_ mode.
4. `mode_frames = 0`,
5. Any `enter` code executes on the _new_ mode and arguments supplied.


Types
---------------------------------------------------------

`is_array(value)`
: Returns true for arrays and false for all other types.

`is_boolean(value)`
: Returns true for booleans and false for all other types.

`is_function(value)`
: Returns true for functions and false for all other types.

`is_nil(value)`
: Returns true for `nil` and false for all other types.

`is_NaN(value)`
: Returns true for the floating point not-a-number value
  `NaN` and false for all other values.
  Note that you cannot test for `NaN` using `==` due to
  floating point NaN rules.

`is_number(value)`
: Returns true for numbers and false for all other types.

`is_object(value)`
: Returns true for objects and false for all other types.

`is_string(value)`
: Returns true for strings and false for all other types.

`type(value)`
: Returns the type of the value as a string: `array`, `boolean`,
  `function`, `nil`, `number`, `object`, or `string`.


Array
---------------------------------------------------------

`array_value(array, i, extrapolate (= array.extrapolate or "clamp"))`
: Applies `floor()` to `i` and then applies the extrapolation mode, which defaults
  to the extrapolation mode of the array itself if specified.
  Intended primarily for animation of values, including
  the named arrays of spritesheets, for example,
  `sprite = array_value(spritesheet[animName], frame)`.
  See also `make_spline()` and the Sprite JSON section. The `extrapolate` values accepted are:

  - `"oscillate"`
  - `"loop"`
  - `"clamp"` (default, other unsupported values are silentely treated as clamp instead of failing)

`clone(array)`
: Return a shallow clone of `array`. Pointer structures are preserved and loops
  are OK. Built-in objects such as spritesheets and functions are not cloned.

`deep_clone(array)`
: Return a deep clone of `array`. Pointer structures are preserved and loops
  are OK. Built-in objects such as spritesheets and functions are not cloned.

`concatenate(array1, array2)`
: Create a new array that contains all elements of `array1` followed by all elements of `array2`.
  Identical to `[...array1, ...array2]`. See also `extend()`.

`equivalent(a, b)`
: Returns true if these arrays have the same length and the elements are
  `==` (does not recursively test if the elements are equivalent).

`extend(array1, array2)`
: Mutate `array1` by pushing all elements of `array2` onto it. Identical to `push(array1, ...array2)`.
  See also `concatenate()`.

`fast_remove_key(array, i)`
: Delete element `i` from the array, swapping it with the last element. O(1) expected amortized time.

`fast_remove_value(array, v)`
: Delete one element that is `== v`, or do nothing if there is no such element. May reorder the
  array and may choose any such element, not necessarily the first. See also `remove_values()`.

`find(array, x, i (= 0))`
: Find the index of the element whose value is `x`, starting at optional index `i` (default 0).
  Returns `∅` if not found. Uses `==` to compare `x` to array values. Runs in linear time in the length of the list
  from `i`.

`insert(array, i, x,...)`
: Inserts the values into the array, starting at index `i` (as in, `array[i] = x` on return)
  and returns the first value inserted. Similar to Python insert and JavaScript splice functions.

`iterate(array, callback)`
: Iterates through array in order using a callback function, with
   optional O(1) order-preserving removal. This is an imperative
   version of map(), filter(), and list comprehension primitives from
   other languages.

   If `callback` is a string, iterate then calls `array[i][callback](array[i])`
   on each element.  If `callback` is a function, it instead calls `callback(array[i])`
   on each element.
   
   Return values from the called function have the following effects:

   - `iterate.REMOVE`: remove the current value and continue iterating
   - `iterate.BREAK`: immediately stop iterating
   - `iterate.REMOVE_AND_BREAK`: remove the current element and then stop processing
   - `iterate.CONTINUE`: continue with iteration. This is not required; as long as the previous
      values are not returned by the callback, the iterator will still continue

   It is illegal for the callback to modify the array itself during iteration.

`join(array, separator (= ""), lastSeparator (= separator), pairSeparator (= lastSeparator), empty (= ""))`
: Joins the elements of the array into a string. Each element converted to a string with `unparse()` if it is not already a string.
  The optional `lastSeparator` allows the final join to use a special case.
  The optional `pairSeparator` is a special separator used for arrays of length two.
  For example `join(inventory, ", ", ", and ", " and ", "nothing")`.
  The optional `empty` value is used if the array has length 0.

`last_key(array)`
: Returns `size(array) - 1`, the last key (that is, index).

`last_value(array)`
: Returns `array[last_key(array)]`.

`pop(array)`
: Remove the last element from the array and return it, or `∅` if the array is empty. O(1) expected amortized time.

`pop_front(array)`
: Remove the first element from the array and return it, or `∅` if the array is empty. O(n) expected amortized time.

`push(array, x, ...)`
: Append `x` and any other arguments to the array and then return the last. O(1) expected
  amortized time for a single argument and O(n) for n arguments.

`push_front(array, x, ...)`
: Insert `x` and any other arguments onto the array, preserving the order
  that they appear in the arguments and then return the first. O(n) expected
  amortized time for a single argument and O(m) for m arguments and
  array of length n.

`remove_key(array, i)`
: Remove element `i` from the array, preserving order. O(n) expected time.

`remove_values(array, x)`
: Remove every instance of `x` in the array, maintaining order. O(n) time in the original
  length of the array.  Does nothing if `x` is not in the array. See also `fast_remove_value()`

`remove_all(array)`
: Remove everything from the array. Same as `resize(array, 0)`.

`resize(array, n)`
: Change the length of the array. O(size(array) + n) time if growing, O(1) if shrinking.

`reverse(array)`
: Reverses the array in place, O(size(array)). Returns nothing to avoid confusion with `reversed()`.

`reversed(array)`
: Returns a shallow, reversed clone of the array, O(size(array))

`random_value(array)`
: Return a random element of the array.

`shuffle(array)`
: Randomizes the array in place using using Knuth-Fisher-Yates in O(n) time. Returns nothing to avoid confusion with `shuffled()`.

`shuffled(array)`
: Returns a shallow, shuffled clone of the array, O(size(array))

`size(array)`
: Get the length of the array. O(1) time.

`slice(array, s, e (= size(array)))`
: Return the subarray of `array` between `s` (inclusive) and
  optional `e` (exclusive, defaults to length).

`sort(array, k, reverse (= false))`
: Sort the array from least to greatest. If `k` is a string, then
  elements of the array are assumed to be objects and are sorted by
  that key. If `k` is a number, then elements of the array are assumed
  to be other arrays or strings and are sorted by that index. If `k`
  is not specified and the array contains objects, then elements are
  sorted by their alphabetically-first key.

  If `k` is a function, then it must be a function of the form
  `compare(a, b)` that returns a positive number if `a` is greater
  than `b`, a negative number if `b` is greater than `a`, and zero if
  they are equal.

  If `k` is not specified and the array contains numbers or strings,
  then they are sorted by natural order.

  If `reverse` is true, then the array is sorted in reverse order
  from greatest to least.


String
---------------------------------------------------------
`array_value(string, i, extrapolate (= string.extrapolate or "clamp"))`
: Applies `floor()` to `i` and then applies the extrapolation mode, which defaults
  to the extrapolation mode of the array itself if specified.
  The `extrapolate` values accepted are:

  - `"oscillate"`
  - `"loop"`
  - `"clamp"` (default, other unsupported values are silentely treated as clamp instead of failing)


`concatenate(a, b)`
: Returns a new string that is `a + b`.

`find(string, x, i (= 0))`
: Find the index of the substring whose value is `x`, starting at
  optional index `i` (default 0).  Returns `∅` if not found. O(n)
  time.

`format_number(n, fmt)`
: Produces a string from number `n` in one of the following formats. Input times are in seconds.
  Each is followed by an example output.

   - `"percent"`: 30%
   - `"commas"` (comma thousand separators): 1,000,000
   - `"spaces"` (space thousand separators): 1 000 000
   - `"binary"`: 0b10100001
   - `"degrees"`: 57°
   - `"hex"`: 0xa1
   - `"scientific"`: 6.022×10²³
   - `"clock12"`: 5:35pm
   - `"clock24"`: 17:35
   - `"stopwatch"`: 1:38.71
   - `"oldstopwatch"`: 1"38'71
   - `"ordinal"`: second
   - `"ordinalabbrev"`: 2ⁿᵈ
   - `".00"` (or any other trailing zero sequence): 4.91
   - `"00"` (or any other leading zero sequence): 07
   - `" 0"` (or any other leading space sequence followed by a zero sequence): " 7"

`last_key(string)`
: Returns `size(string) - 1`.

`last_value(string)`
: Returns `string[last_key(string)]`.

`lowercase(s)`
: Returns the lower case version of the string.

`parse(s)`
: Parse a string that was encoded using `unparse()` and convert it back into the original
  data structure. Functions, built-ins, and recursive arrays cannot be converted.

`replace(string, src, dst)`
: Replace all occurances of `src` in `string` with `dst`.

`replace(string, object)`
: Replace all occurances of each key of `object` with each `value` of object in `string`
  simultaneously. For example,
  `replace("Hey, PROPER_NOUN, use the ADJ NOUN!", {ADJ: "big", NOUN: "stick", PROPER_NOUN: "Runi"})`.

`reversed(string)`
: Returns a reversed version of the string in O(size) time.

`shuffled(string)`
: Returns a shuffled version of the string in O(size) time.

`size(s)`
: Get the length of the string. O(1) time.

`slice(string, s, e (= size(str)))`
: Return the substring of `string` between `s` (inclusive) and
  optional `e` (exclusive, defaults to length).

`split(string, separator (=""))`
: Returns an array of strings separated by `separator`. If the separator is the empty string, then all characters are separated.

`unparse(x)`
: Returns code that is equivalent to producing data object `x`, if it is not a
  recursive object or array or a function. Note that strings will have quotes
  around them in the resulting string.

`uppercase(s)`
: Returns the upper case version of the string.


Object
---------------------------------------------------------
`clone(object)`
: Return a shallow clone of `object`. Pointer structures are preserved and loops
  are OK. Built-in objects such as spritesheets and functions are not cloned.

`deep_clone(object)`
: Return a deep clone of `object`. Pointer structures are preserved and loops
  are OK. Built-in objects such as spritesheets and functions are not cloned.

`concatenate(object1, object2)`
: Create a new object that is the union of `object1` and `object2`,
  where `object2` keys override in the case of collisions.
  See also `extend()`.

`extend(object1, object2)`
: Mutate `object1` by assigning all elements of `object2` into it,
  overriding any existing keys in the case of collisions.
  See also `concatenate()`.

`fast_remove_key(object, k)`
: Same as `remove_key` for a object.

`fast_remove_value(object, value)`
: Delete one element that is `== v`, or do nothing if there is no such element.
  See also `remove_values()`.

`find(object, x)`
: Find a key for which the value is `x`.
  Returns `∅` if not found. Uses `==` to compare `x` to array values.
  O(n) time in the number of key-value pairs.

`keys(object)`
: An array of the keys in the object. You almost never need this because
  `for k in object` iterates over the keys directly.

`remove_key(object, k)`
: Remove a key-value pair by key. Does nothing if `k` is not in the object.
  Use `object[k] ≠ ∅` to test for containment explicitly.

`remove_values(object, v)`
: Remove every instance of `v` from the object. See also `fast_remove_value()`.

`remove_all(object)`
: Remove everything from the object. It is faster to assign to a new, empty object than to
  use this function. `remove_all()` is for when it is important to retain a pointer
  to the original object because it is shared.

`size(object)`
: The number of entries in the object.

`values(object)`
: An array of the values in the object.


Random Values
---------------------------------------------------------

### 1D

`make_random(seed (= local_time().millisecond))`
: Returns a new _function_ that acts like `random()` but has its own private
  seed and internal state. See also `set_random_seed()`.

`random()`
: `random(0, 1)`

`random(lo, hi)`
: Random real number between `lo` and `hi`, excluding `hi`. See also the `ξ` operator, the no-argument version
  of `random()`.

`random_gaussian()`
: Same as `random_gaussian(0, 1, random)`

`random_gaussian(mean, stddev, random (= random))`
: Returns a Gaussian distributed random number on the distribution
  with the given mean and standard deviation. See also `random_truncated_gaussian()`.

`random_integer(hi)`
: Uniformly distributed random integer between 0 and hi, inclusive.
  This version is deprecated. Use `random_integer(0, hi)` instead.

`random_integer(lo, hi, random (= random))`
: Random integer between `lo` and `hi`, including both ends.
  The `random` argument defaults to common random number generator `random()`, but
  an alternative function previously created by `make_random()` can be
  passed instead.

`random_sign(random (= random))`
: Returns +1 or -1 with equal probability.

`random_truncated_gaussian(mean, stddev, radius, random (= random))`
: Returns a Gaussian distributed random number within `radius` of
  the mean. See also `random_gaussian()`.

  with the given mean and standard deviation. The mean and standard
  deviation may each be scalar or `xy()` values.
  See also `random_gaussian()`, `random_truncated_gaussian2D()`.

`random_on_circle(random (= random))`

Vector
---------------------------------------------------------

Most of the math functions and operators defined for numbers also
operate component-wise on vectors represented as structures or arrays.
For example, `clamp()`, `min()`, `loop()`, `+`, `/`, etc.

The following vector operations can be applied to any array or object,
including `xy()` and `rgb()` values, except where specific key names are mentioned:

`atan(vec2)`
: Returns `atan(vec2.y, vec2.x)`.

`cross(a, b)`
: Return the vector cross product of two arrays of length three each or two vectors with
  `x`, `y`, and `z` fields. For arguments of length two or without a `z` component,
  returns `a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x`, which is the 2D wedge product.

`direction(v)`
: `v / magnitude(v)` if the magnitude is greater than 10<sup>-10</sup>, otherwise returns the original
  (nearly zero) vector. That is, returns a normalized or unit vector unless the input is close to zero.

`dot(a, b)`
: Return the dot (inner) product of any two structures or arrays with parallel
  elements.

`equivalent(a, b)`
: Returns true if these vectors have the same size and the elements are
  `==` (does not recursively test if the elements are equivalent).

`magnitude(v)`
: The square root of the sum of the elements (L2 norm).

`magnitude_squared(v)`
: The sum of squares of the elements.

`max_component(v)`
: Largest element.

`min_component(v)`
: Smallest element.

`perp(v)`
: Returns a vector perpendicular to `v` by rotating it 90 degrees:
  `xy(-v.y, v.x)`, for `xy()` and 2-element array vectors only.

`xy(x, y)`
: Create the object with `x` and `y` fields.

`xy(v)`
: Returns `{x:v.x, y:v.y}`. Useful for removing the `z` component or cloning.
  See also `xy_to_xz()`.

`xy(a)`
: Returns `{x:a[0], y:a[1]}`. Useful for converting from a matrix column.

`xy_to_xz(v)`
: Returns `{x:v.x, z:v.y}`. See also `xz_to_xy()`.

`xy_to_xyz(v, z (= 0))`
: Returns `{x:v.x, y:v.y, z:z}`.

`xz(x, z)`
: Create the object with `x` and `z` fields.

`xz(v)`
: Returns `{x:v.x, z:v.z}`. Useful for removing the `y` component or cloning.

`xz(a)`
: Returns `{x:a[0], z:a[1]}`. Useful for converting from a matrix column.

`xz_to_xy(v)`
: Returns `{x:v.x, y:v.z}`. See also `xy_to_xz()`.

`xz_to_xyz(v, y (= 0))`
: Returns `{x:v.x, y:y, z:v.z}`. See also `xz_to_xy()`.

`xyz(x, y, z)`
: Create the object with `x`, `y`, and `z` fields.

`xyz(v)`
: Returns `{x:v.x, y:v.y, z:v.z}`. Useful for removing a `w` component.
  Will _not_ expand an `xy()` or `xz()` value--you must do that explicitly as
  `xyz(v.x, v.y, 0)`, for example

`xyz(a)`
: Returns `{x:a[0], y:a[1], z:a[2]}`. Useful for converting from a matrix column.

`xyz_to_rgb(v)`
: Returns `{r: v.x, g: v.y, b: v.z}`.


Function
---------------------------------------------------------

`call(f, a, b, ...)`
: Invoke function `f` with arguments `a`, `b`, etc.



Math
---------------------------------------------------------
`abs(x)`
: Absolute value

`acos(x)`
: Inverse cosine in radians

`atan(y, x)`
: Arctangent of y/x, in radians. See also the version that operates on an `xy()`.

`asin(x)`
: Inverse sine in radians

`cbrt(x)`
: Cube root of `x`. Has the same sign as the argument.

`ceil(x)`
: Return the nearest integer value of `x` towards positive infinity.

`ceil(x, u)`
: Ceil to the nearest multiple of `u` using `ceil(x / u) * u`.

`clamp(x, lo, hi)`
: Clamp `x` to the range [`lo`, `hi`] inclusive.

`clone(v)`
: Return a shallow clone of `v`

`copy(s, d)`
: Copy the properties of `s` onto `d`. Both must be arrays or objects.

`cos(x)`
: Cosine, `x` in radians

`deep_clone(v)`
: Return a deep clone of `v`. Pointer structures are preserved and loops
  are OK. Built-in objects such as spritesheets and functions are not cloned.

`floor(x)`
: Return the nearest integer value of `x` towards negative infinity.

`floor(x, u)`
: Floor to the nearest multiple of `u` using `floor(x / u) * u`.

`hash(x, y)`
: A hash value of string or number `x`, returning a value on [0, 1].
  If `y` is specified, the hash considers the union of the values.

`lerp(a, b, t)`
: Returns `a * (1 - t) + b * t`. See also `smoothstep()` and `smootherstep()`.

`log(x)`
: Natural logarithm (base _e_) of `x`, _ln x_ in math notation.

`log2(x)`
: Logarithm base 2 `x`, _lg x_ in math notation.

`log10(x)`
: Logarithm base 10 `x`, _log x_ in math notation.

`loop(x, lo, hi)`
: Handy for making values wrap around. Real-number relative floored modulus. Wraps `x` to the range [`lo`, `hi`). See also `oscillate()`

`loop(x, hi)`
: Handy for making values wrap around. Real-number floored modulus. Wraps `x` to the range [0, `hi`). `hi` defaults to `1.0` if not specified. See also `oscillate()`

`magnitude(x, y, ...)`
: The square root of the sum of the arguments, which must all be numbers.
  Same as `magnitude([x, y, ...])`.

`magnitude_squared(x, y, ...)`
: The sum of the squares of the arguments, which must all be numbers.
  Same as `magnitude_squared([x, y, ...])`.

`make_spline(timeArray, valueArray, order = 3, extrapolate = "stall")`
: Returns a function mapping numbers to values by piecewise polynomial
  interpolation. The value array must have types for which `*` and `+`
  operate (which includes numbers, `xy()`, `xyz()`, `rgb()`, and
  `rgba()` values, and arrays of numbers), and all elements must have
  the same type. The spline is always interpolating. The `timeArray`
  and `valueArray` must have the same length.

  `order`:
  - `0` = nearest neighbor
  - `1` = linear (polyline)
  - `3` = cubic (Catmull-Rom) spline

  `extrapolate`:
  - `"loop"` = cyclic. The `timeArray` must have one more element than the `valueArray`.
     That final value is the looped time that matches the start time. Similar to OpenGL
     REPEAT mode for textures.
  - `"clamp"` = hold the final value. Similar to OpenGL CLAMP texture mode.
  - `"stall"` = interpolate to additional control points that match the final value.
     Unlike clamping, for a cubic curve this will ensure that the velocity smoothly
     guides into zero rather than creating a sharp corner.
  - `"oscillate"` = treat like looping with twice the period, reversing direction.
    This is similar to OpenGL MIRROR texture mode.
  - `"continue"` = continue the curve with the trend of the final control points

`max(a, b, ...)`
: Largest of the arguments

`min(a, b, ...)`
: Smallest of the arguments

`mid(a, b, c)`
: Middle argument once sorted. Can be used for clamping.

`noise(octaves, v)`
: Applies `noise()` to an `xy()`, `xyz()`, or array position.

`noise(octaves, x, y (=0), z (=0))`
: Value noise on the range [-1, 1], bicubically interpolated between integer locations at
  octave 0. Unused dimensions default to zero.

`oscillate(x, m)`
: Deprecated. `oscillate(x, 0, m)`.

`oscillate(x)`
: `oscillate(x, 0, 1)`

`oscillate(x, lo, hi)`
: Like `loop` but alternately counts up and down on the interval
  [`lo`, `hi`], including both ends. Works with negative and fractional values.
  Let `k = 2 m - 2; w = loop(x, k)`.
  `oscillate(x, m)` is `w` if `w < m`, otherwise it is `k - w`.

`pow(a, b)`
: Exponent. See also the `^` operator.

`round(x)`
: Return the nearest integer value of `x`. Half-integers round towards positive infinity.

`round(x, u)`
: Return the nearest value of `x` quantized to `u`: `round(x, u) == round(x * u) / u`.

`sign(x)`
: Sign of `x`. Returns -1 if `x` is less than zero, -0 if `x` is -0,
  +0 if `x` is +0, and +1 if `x` is greater than zero.

`sign_nonzero(x)`
: Returns -1 if `x` is less than zero, otherwise returns +1.

`smoothstep(t_start, t_end, t)`
: Transition from 0 at `t = t_start` to 1 at `t = t_end`. All arguments must be numbers.
  Typically used as `lerp(A, B, smoothstep(lo, hi, t))` where `A` and `B` are colors or points.
  This is a common graphics function for cubic Hermite interpolation. See also
  the [GLSL documentation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/smoothstep.xhtml).

`smootherstep(t_start, t_end, t)`
: Transition from 0 at `t = t_start` to 1 at `t = t_end` with more
  gradual acceleration than `smoothstep`. All arguments must be
  numbers.  Typically used as `lerp(A, B, smootherstep(lo, hi, t))`
  where `A` and `B` are colors or points.  This is a common graphics
  function for fifth-order interpolation.

`sqrt(x)`
: Square root.

`sin(x)`
: Sine of `x` radians.

`tan(x)`
: Tangent of `x` radians.

[Figure [coords]: Screen space coordinate system.]

Almost all standard library functions take arguments in world space.
This includes drawing routines, intersection routines, and the properties
of entities without parents. The functions that don't use screen space
are obvious, since what they do requires another space.

If you use default values of the camera, transform, and `y_up`, and do
not use child entities, then world space and camera space match the
screen space coordinate system and you can ignore the rest of this section.

Advanced users can leverage the full set of coordinate systems for the
standard library, which are:

- *screen* space (ss)
- *world* space (ws)
- *camera* space (cs)
- *entity* space (es) 
- *sprite* space - pixels within in a sprite
- *map* space - indices of sprites in a map
<!-- - *spritesheet* space - indices of sprites in a spritesheet -->

Entities can also form hierarchies using the `entity.child_array`. The first four coordinate
systems are related by:

To simplify common game programming tasks and avoid certain kinds of mistakes,
quadplay has some differences from traditional graphics systems under coordinate
system transformations:

- Angles are always measured counter-clockwise, and routines automatically 
  change their angle direction to compensate. Use `rotation_sign()` to
  determine the current direction when using `sin()` and `cos()` to convert
  an angle to a vector.
  
- Sprites automatically flip vertically to match when the y axis is inverted.

- The anchor points for text will transform, but font characters are never
  rendered with scale or rotation because pixel fonts are generally unreadable if
  transformed and upside-down fonts are rarely what is intended when flipping an axis.
  Convert your text to a sprite if you want transformed text as an effect, or use a set of
  fonts available at different sizes (such as deja) if you want text at different sizes to
  correspond to zooming.

- `touch`, `gamepad_array[]`, and `joy` `xy` values match the current screen-to-camera space
  transformation from `set_transform` at the time that they are read. This is mostly
  so that controls and event coordinates will match drawing coordinates when the
  axis is flipped or the screen origin changed.
  
- Every `entity` contains both a transformation to its parent (`entity.pos_in_parent`, `entity.angle_in_parent`, `entity.scale_in_parent`, `entity.z_in_parent`)
  and a transformation directly to world space (`entity.pos`, `entity.angle`, `entity.scale`, `entity.z`).
  Storing the direct transformation improves performance and simplifies many common operations.
  `entity_update_children(root)` recursively updates the direct transformation for an entire hierarchy.

In general, `set_transform()` is good for tasks such as, "I'm making
the user interface and want Y=down and 0 at top left" or "I'm
drawing the world and want Y=up and the origin in the center". It
cannot rotate the viewpoint. 

`set_camera()` is for shifting the viewpoint in 2.5D within
the world coordinate system. It cannot flip axes (it only allows
positive, uniform zoom), but it can rotate, translate, and zoom. 
Use it to show different views of the same scene, follow a character,
or render a minimap. 
  
Common situations are:
  
 - No camera or transform. Use `y_up` in the game.json file if you want the y axis to go up
 - Move (0, 0) to the center of the screen: `set_transform(SCREEN_SIZE / 2)`
 - Center on the player entity, without rotation: `set_transform(SCREEN_SIZE / 2); set_camera(pos:player_entity.pos})`
 - Center on the player and rotate the y-axis to match (good for sprites drawn facing up): `set_transform(SCREEN_SIZE / 2); set_camera(player_entity)`
 - Center on the player and rotate the x-axis to the y-axis (good if you want `player.angle=0` to be the x-axis) `set_transform(SCREEN_SIZE / 2); set_camera({pos:player_entity, angle:player.angle - 90deg})`

The coordinate systems are defined by transformations _from_ a
coordinate system to its parent always being applied in the order of
scale, rotation (`angle`), translation (`pos`). That is, objects scale
along their own axes and rotate about their own origin.

The transformation routines are:

`transform_cs_to_ss(cs_point, cs_z (= 0))`
: Transform `cs_point` at `cs_z` from camera space to screen space. The `cs_z` is needed 
  only if a skew transformation is active.
  
`transform_cs_z_to_ss_z(cs_z)`
: Transform camera space `cs_z` to a screen space z value.

`transform_ss_to_cs(ss_point, ss_z (= 0))`
: Transform `ss_point` from screen space to camera space.

`transform_ss_z_to_cs_z(cs_z)`
: Transform screen space `ss_z` to a camera space z value.
  If the current transform has a zero z-scale then the result will be positive infinity,
  negative infinity, or zero because the transformation is not invertible in that case.

`transform_ws_to_cs(ws_point, ws_z (= 0))`
: Transform world space `ws_point` to camera space. There is no
  transformation function for `cs_z` value because you can 
  transform it yourself `cs_z = ws_z - get_camera().z`.

`transform_cs_to_ws(cs_point, cs_z (= 0))`
: Transform camera space `cs_point` to world space. There is no
  transformation function for `cs_z` because you can transform
  it yourself as `ws_z = cs_z + get_camera().z`.

`transform_ws_to_es(entity, ws_point)`
: Transform world space point `ws_point` into the entity space of `entity`, wherever it is
  in the hierarchy. There is no transformation function for `ws_z` because you can transform
  it yourself as `es_z = ws_z - entity.z`.

`transform_es_to_ws(entity, es_point)`
: Transform entity space point `es_point` into world space, wherever the entity is in the hierarchy.
  There is no transformation function for `es_z` because you can transform
  it yourself as `ws_z = es_z + entity.z`.

`transform_to_parent(child, child_point)`
: Takes a coordinate `child_point` in the `child` entity reference frame and transforms it to
  the `child.parent` entity reference frame.

`transform_to_child(child, parent_point)`
: Takes a coordinate `parent_point` in the `child.parent` entity reference frame and transforms it to
  the `child` entity reference frame.

`transform_es_to_es(entity_from, entity_to, es_from_point)`
: Transform the `es_from_point` in the reference frame of
  `entity_from` to the reference frame of `entity_to`.
  There is no transformation function for `z` values because you can transform
  it yourself as `z += entity_from.z - entity_to.z`.

`transform_es_to_sprite_space(entity, es_point)`
: Transform `es_point` in the reference frame of `entity`
  into the pixel coordinates of the current `entity.sprite`.
  
`transform_sprite_space_to_es(entity, sprite_point)`
: Transform `sprite_point` in the pixel coordinates of the
  current `entity.sprite` into the reference frame of the
  entity.

`transform_to(pos, angle, scale, point)`
: Transform `point` into the reference frame defined by `pos`, `angle`, and `scale`.

`transform_from(pos, angle, scale, point)`
: Transform `point` from the reference frame defined by `pos`, `angle`, and `scale`.


### Screen Space

Note that `preserving_transform` also preserves the clipping rectangle.

`compose_transform(args)`
: Named argument version of `compose_transform()`.

`compose_transform(pos (= ∅), dir (= ∅), z (= ∅), zDir (= ∅), skew (= ∅))`
: Apply this local transformation _before_ the current one. Used for entering a child
  coordinate system. Nil arguments or properties default to `(xy(0, 0), xy(1, 1), 0, 1, xy(0, 0))`.
  Use `preserving_transform` or `get_transform()` plus `set_transform()` to save and restore
  nested coordinate systems.

`get_transform()`
: Returns the current net transformation as an `args` object that could be passed to
  `set_transform(args)`.

`preserving_transform:`
: The special `preserving_transform:` block saves the current transform, camera, and
  clipping region, executes the code in the body, and then restores the
  previous transform and clipping region when the block is exited (including abruptly by 
  `return`, `continue`, or `break`). It is useful for making modular
  functions for handling UI scrolling, minimaps, and screenshake. 

`rotation_sign()`
: Returns -1 if `(t.dir.x * t.dir.y > 0)` for `t = get_transform()`
  and +1 if `(t.dir.x * t.dir.y < 0)`. Useful for computing the
  coordinate transform of an entity angle. Angles are always measured
  counter-clockwise on *screen*.  In the *draw coordinate system*, they
  rotate counter-clockwise if `rotation_sign() = 1` and clockwise if
  `rotation_sign() = -1` (which is the default). This is used by `draw_sprite()`
  to determine the rotation direction. See also `up_y()`.

`reset_transform()`
: Reset to the default transformation, `set_transform(xy(0, 0), xy(1, 1), 0, 1, xy(0, 0))`.
  This overrides the `y_up` flag from the .game.json file.

`set_transform(args)`
: Named argument object version of `set_transform()`.

`set_transform(pos (= ∅), dir (= ∅), z (= ∅), zDir (= ∅), skew (= ∅))`
: Set the transformation applied to all draw coordinates to compute screen coordinates. Nil values
  or nil properties default to their previous value. The equation
  mapping draw to screen coordinates is:
  `screen.x = (draw.x + skew.x * draw.z) * dir.x + pos.x`;
  `screen.y = (draw.y + skew.y * draw.z) * dir.y + pos.y`;
  `screen.z = draw.z * zDir + z`.

  The `dir` parameters must be +1 or -1, for flipping axes. This
  affects the location of sprites and text but not their own axes;
  text will always render right side up and sprites must be
  independently flipped.

  By default, increasing z is towards the viewer, a negative direction can
  be used to make increasing values farther back.

  The skew transform applies after direction flipping and can be used for isometric 3D.

`up_y()`
: Returns `-sign(get_transform().dir.y)`, which is -1 if Y increases downwards (the default)
  and +1 if Y increases upwards (`"y_up": true` in the .game.json file).



The clipping region is the only object interacted with in *screen
space*, via `set_clip()`, `get_clip()`, and `intersect_clip()`.

The screen space graphics coordinate system is:

- x increasing from 0 at the left edge of the screen to `SCREEN_SIZE.x` at the right edge
- y increasing from 0 at the top edge of the screen to `SCREEN_SIZE.y` at the bottom edge
- z increasing from -2047 at the back to 2048 at the front

Integer coordinates correspond to the top-left corner of a pixel.
Pixel centers are therefore at integers plus ½ and the top-left 
pixel center s (½, ½).

Drawing commands sample at pixel centers. The pixel ownership rules
are bottom and right, so a primitive that has a top or left boundary
exactly on a pixel center will not color that pixel. This is important
for adjacent primitives to keep them from double-covering a pixel on
the boundary. When thinking of the screen as a 2D array of discrete
pixel elements, the snapping rule is essentially that a 1-pixel rectangle
centered at `pos` colors pixel `⌊pos⌋`.

For example, the rectangle from (0, 0) to
(2, 1) covers two pixel centers: (0.5, 0.5) and (1.5, 0.5). 
Setting this as the
clipping region makes two pixels visible.

This coordinate system favors intuition for centered, even-sized
objects such as sprites. It also gives the result that you might
intuitively expect for odd-sized objects at integer or half-integer coordinates
such as odd-width text,
1-pixel points at integers, and 1-pixel horizontal and vertical lines. Diagonal
1-pixel lines and points at non-integer, non-half locations will round in ways
that are less intuitive.

`draw_point(pos)` draws a one-pixel rectangle from `pos - ½` to `pos + ½`.
So, when passed integer arguments, `pos` = (0, 0) will color the top-left pixel and `SCREEN_SIZE - 1` is the
lower-right. Any value from 0 to (1 - `ε`) will write to the
the first pixel. When seeking to draw individual pixels aligned with the grid,
I recommend that you use integer plus 1/2 coordinates
for `draw_point()` for robustness. However, if you use integer coordinates, it will
"do what you expect".

`draw_line()` draws a line centered on its endpoints that
extends ½ pixel beyond its endpoints. When seeking to draw horizontal and vertical lines
aligned with the grid, I recommend that you use integer plus ½ coordinates
for `draw_point()` for robustness. However, if you use integer coordinates, it will
"do what you expect". For other lines, you may be surprised by the result if they
aren't at half-pixel offsets.

A 4x4 sprite (or circle or text character) with its top and left
edge aligned with the screen edges is centered on coordinate (2, 2),
that is, half its width and height. A 3x3 object aligned as such
is centered at (1.5, 1.5) but will draw in the same way if centered
at (1, 1), which would be consistent with integer pixel centers.
The center of the entire screen is `½ SCREEN_SIZE`.

### Camera Space

Note that `preserving_transform` also preserves the camera.

`get_camera()`
: Returns the current camera as an `args` object that could be passed to `set_camera(args)`.

`reset_camera()`
: `set_camera({pos: xy(0, 0), angle: 0deg, zoom: 100%, z: 0})`

`set_camera(args)`
: Named argument object version of `set_camera()`.

`set_camera(pos (= xy(0, 0)), angle (= 0), zoom (= 1), z (= 0))`
: Positions the camera used to transform other draw calls. Note that
  `zoom` is the inverse of a scale transformation on the camera
  itself.  Use `set_transform()` to move the on-screen origin.
  
  `zoom` can be a number or a function, `zoom(cs_z)`. If it is a
  function, it computes the zoom factor for an object at `cs_z` in
  camera space.  This is useful for creating pseudo-3D effects. If you
  do not want your map layers to zoom in perspective, set the
  `"z_scale"` value in the map.json file to a small number or
  zero. Enabling a zoom function with nonzero `z_scale` can make map
  rendering significantly slower in the case of multiple layers
  because it disables occlusion culling.
  
  To render sprites with parallax but 1:1 pixel scaling when using a
  zoom function, set the sprite or entity `scale` to `1 / camera.zoom(entity.pos.z - camera.pos.z)`.

### Entity Space

Each entity has its own coordinate system defined by `entity.pos`,
`entity.scale`, and `entity.angle`. The `entity.scale` is often used to
flip sprites from left to right, which also flips the entity's local
coordinate system. 

In most cases, you won't have to think about entity space beyond setting
those fields. Entitys drawn with sprites and interacting with physics
automatically handle the transformations. Only if you're doing detailed
manipulation of children or drawing explicitly in entity space do you
need to apply transformations.

The direction of `entity.angle` is always counter-clockwise in screen
coordinates. The direction in draw coordinates is given by
`rotation_sign()`.

******************************************************************

The axes of the entity space in draw space are given by:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const θ = rotation_sign() * entity.angle
const X = xy( cos θ, sin θ) * entity.scale
const Y = xy(-sin θ, cos θ) * entity.scale

// or

const X = transform_entity_to_draw(entity, xy(1, 0)) - entity.pos
const Y = transform_entity_to_draw(entity, xy(0, 1)) - entity.pos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Entity space is mostly used for moving a character relative to its own
axes or resolving attachment points. Drawing commands always take 
world space arguments and physics, per-pixel hit detection, and sprite drawing
automatically handle the world-to-entity transformation for you.

In the rare case where you want to draw in entity space, you can transform the arguments to world space:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
draw_disk(transform_es_to_ws(entity, es_pos), es_radius * entity.scale.x, color)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This works even if the entity is deep in an entity hierarchy.
When drawing a shape with more parameters, the draw commands have additional arguments to help
with this process. For example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
draw_rect(transform_es_to_ws(entity, es_pos), size * entity.scale, fill, border, entity.angle, entity.z)
draw_poly(es_vertex_array, fill, border, entity.pos, entity.angle, entity.scale, entity.z))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Sprite Pixel Coordinates

Sprite coordinates are used by `get_sprite_pixel_color()`. These are integers
with (0,0) on the top left of the sprite and (`sprite.size.x` - 1, `sprite.size.y` - 1)
on the lower right.


### Spritesheet Indices

*Sprite sheets* use integer coordinates with (0, 0) at the upper-left
corner and (`size(sheet)` - 1, `size(sheet[0])` - 1) at the
lower-right corner. Instead of functions for operating on these, sprite
sheets are directly accessed as 2D arrays: `sheet[x][y]`.

### Map Cell Indices

*Map space* integer coordinates used by maps have (0, 0) as upper-left
tile and `map.size` - 1 at the lower-right tile.
Maps are typically accessed as 2D arrays: `map.layer[L][x][y]`. For
convenience, `map[x][y]` is a shorthand for `map.layer[0][x][y]`.

The top-left corners of map cells are at integers when converting
between map and draw coordinates. When rendered, a map therefore
covers the same region as the drawing command
`draw_corner_rect(xy(0,0), map.size * tileSize, #f)`.

The map is aligned by default so that `draw_map()` renders the top-left
corner of the map to the top-left corner of the screen. Use
`offset` in the `.map.json` file or `set_transform()` to alter
the location of the map when rendered.


Animations
------------------------------------------------------------

Each named sprite animation `spritesheet["`<i>animation_name</i>`"]`
or `spritesheet.`<i>animation_name</i> of a spritesheet is an array
that has the following immutable properties:

`animation.period`
: Number of frames before the animation repeats, which is
  `0` for `clamp` animations.

`animation.frames`
: Number of frames before the animation ends, which is
  `infinity` for `loop` or `oscillate` animations.

`animation.frame(t)`
: Return the sprite to show for the animation at time `t` measured in frames, obeying the individual
  `sprite.frames` durations and wrapping or clamping appropriately.

Because it is an array, the i<sup>th</sup> sprite is `animation[i]` and
you can loop that using `array_value(animation, i)` or choose a random
one with `random_value(animation)`.

To create an animation, there must be a `start` field in the named 
entry of the .sprite.json file.


Sprite
------------------------------------------------------------

Each sprite element `spritesheet[x][y]` of a spritesheet has the following immutable properties.
Sprites can also be referenced by name `spritesheet["`<i>name</i>`"]` or 
`spritesheet.`<i>name</i>, if the named sprite has an `x` and `y` field instead of
a `start` field in the .sprite.json file.

`sprite.id`
: Unique integer identifying this sprite. This may change every time
  the program is run.

`sprite.frames`
: Number of 1/60-second (≈ 16.7 ms) game frames to hold this sprite during animation.
  Set by the spritesheet's `default_frames`, the animation's `default_frames`,
  or the animation's per-sprite `frames` array.

`sprite.x_flipped`
: The corresponding derived sprite that is this sprite flipped horizontally.
  Flipped sprites are created on spritesheet load but can only be accessed
  through the non-flipped sprites. Note that `s.x_flipped.x_flipped == s`.

`sprite.y_flipped`
: The corresponding derived sprite that is this sprite flipped vertically.
  Flipped sprites are created on spritesheet load but can only be accessed
  through the non-flipped sprites. Note that `s.y_flipped.y_flipped == s`.

`sprite.scale`
: An `xy()` value that is `xy(1,1)` for sprites extracted directly from
  the spritesheet and may be +1 or -1 in each axis for flipped sprites.

`sprite.size`
: `xy()` dimensions of the sprite in pixels.

`sprite.spritesheet`
: From which this sprite is taken.

`sprite.tile_index`
: Integer `xy()` index of the sprite in its spritesheet.


Entity
------------------------------------------------------------

The entity system is optional. It is convenient for providing fast,
reliable implementations of common game-like simulation operations for
prototyping. There are three categories of entity abstraction: basic,
physics, and hierarchy. Use whichever level of complexity is useful to
you, or simply build your own system if you wish. Note that due to "duck
typing", you can apply entity functions to any object that has the
right subset of fields for that function.

In addition to the built-in entity properties, you can add whatever
properties you wish. Beware that the following properties are
available as user properties today, but are likely to be added as
built-in properties in the future: `density` and `friction`.


### Basic

`draw_entity(e, recurse (= true))`
: Draw the entity, if its sprite is defined. If `recurse` is true,
  also draws all of the elements of `e.child_array` recursively (see
  the Hierarchy section).

`make_entity(obj (= {}), childTable (= {}))`
: Returns a new entity object that is `obj` with defaults applied for
  any properties not specified. This is forward compatible to any
  extended properties that might be added in future versions, however,
  those properties might conflict with any that you add on your
  own. The built-in entity properties are all cloned if specified. All
  other properties of `obj` are copied over but not cloned.

  If the `childTable` second argument is provided (note that this is not
  a property of `obj`), then all of the keys become fields of the new
  entity and the values are added to the entity's `child_array`. This is
  a convenient way to build entity hierarchies.

  If a `child_array` property is specified on `obj`, then
  `entity_add_child()` is called for each element of this array and
  `entity_update_children()` is automatically invoked after the new entity
  is constructed.


The basic entity properties and defaults are:

`entity.angle`
: The world space angle from the x-axis to y-axis in radians. See
  `draw_sprite()`. Defaults to 0.

`entity.name`
: A string useful for debugging and error messages. Defaults to `"entity"` +
  a unique number.

`entity.offset`
: A draw-space value added to `entity.pos` by `draw_entity()`. Useful
  for causing the drawn position to temporarily drift from the
  simulated position for effects like shake or blowback after a hit.
  Defaults to `xy(0, 0)`. _Does not affect bounds for `overlaps()`._
  See also `entity.pivot`.

`entity.opacity`
: Visibility on the interval 0 to 1. Defaults to 1.

`entity.pivot`
: Point on the sprite that is mapped to the center of the entity for
  collision detection bounds and child reference frames. _Does not affect rendering_.
  Defaults to the pivot form the intial
  sprite, or `xy(0, 0)` if there was no sprite. If you change the
  `entity.sprite`, then you may want to also change the `entity.pivot`
  at the same time. See also `entity.offset` for transient effects.

`entity.pos`
: The world space `xy` position of the center of the entity. Defaults to (0,0).

`entity.scale`
: The world space `xy` scaling applied before translation and rotation. See `draw_sprite()`.
  Defaults to (1, 1). This can be used to grow, stretch, or flip the entity.
  If `entity.shape == "disk"`, then the scale must have the same magnitude
  in both x and y.

`entity.shape`
: A string that is `disk` or `rect`. Defaults to `rect`. A `disk` entity
  must have scale that is the same in x and y.

`entity.size`
: The draw-space `xy()` size of the width and height of the bounding
  box of the entire object in its own reference frame.  If
  `entity.shape == "disk"`, then the `x` and `y` fields must have the
  same value. If not specified, defaults to the sprite's size.

`entity.sprite`
: A sprite from a sprite sheet. Can be `nil`.

`entity.sprite_override_color`
: Blends over the color of the sprite with this color (only works
  if there is a sprite). See `draw_sprite()` for details. Defaults to `nil`.

`entity.z`
: z-order position (a number). Defaults to zero.


Examples of creating an entity with different shapes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Disk
e = make_entity({pos:P, shape:"disk", size: xy(diameter, diameter)})

// Square
e = make_entity({pos:P, shape:"rect", size: xy(edge, edge)})

// Rectangle
e = make_entity({pos:P, shape:"rect", size: xy(w, h)})

// Line
e = make_entity({pos:(A + B) / 2, shape:"rect",
                size: xy(magnitude(B - A), 0),
                angle:atan(B.y - A.y, B.x - A.x)})
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entity system is designed to be extensible. You can add your own
properties to it, and aren't required to use it at all...make direct
`draw_sprite()` calls if you don't like this. You can also use the
entity system but replace the rendering if you prefer. For example,
if you'd like to register your own draw function callbacks instead
of using the sprite rendering, you can do this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
def draw(e):
   if e.draw: e.draw(e)
   for c in e.child_array: draw(c)

def drawInBox(e):
   draw_corner_rect(e.pos, e.size, #FFF)
   draw_sprite(e.sprite, e.pos)

let e = make_entity({..., draw:drawInBox})

draw(e)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Example of replacing `draw_entity` with a version that uses arbitrary callbacks.]


### Label Properties

A text label is drawn for the entity if `entity.text and
entity.font` is not `nil`. This is useful for showing player
names, map labels, RPG stats, scores, and character dialogue. The full
set of label properties is:

- `entity.text`
- `entity.font`
- `entity.text_x_align`
- `entity.text_y_align`
- `entity.text_offset` (this is not affected by entity rotation but is affected by scale)
- `entity.text_color`
- `entity.text_shadow`
- `entity.text_outline`


### Physics Properties

A key relating textbook symbols and definitions to the quadplay✜ entity property names is:

  Property        | Symbol                           | Definition
  ----------------|----------------------------------|------------------
  `pos`           | _x_(_t_)                         | Position
  `vel`           | _v_(_t_) = _dx_(_t_) / _dt_      | Linear velocity
  `force`         | _F_(_t_) = _m_ • _a_(_t_)        | Force
  `angle`         | _θ_(_t_)                         | Angle
  `spin`          | _ω_(_t_) = _dθ_(_t_) / _dt_      | Angular velocity
  `torque`        | _τ_(_t_) = _I_ • _α_(_t_)        | Torque
  `inertia`       | _I_                              | Inertia
  `density`       | _ρ_                              | Density
  `friction`      | _μ_ₖ                             | Coefficient of kinetic friction
  `stiction_factor`| _μ_ₛ/_μ_ₖ                       | Static friction multiplier
  `restitution`   | _e_                              | Coefficient of restitution

You can choose the units and coordinate system. Pixels (of distance),
pixel mass, and game frames are the most common choice of units in
order to simplify conversion factors.

See also the Physics section for relevant functions.

`entity.force`
: `xy()` linear force. Defaults to (0, 0).
  Has units of mass * pixels / frame^2 by default.
  Typical forces are on the scale 1-10.

`entity.density`
: In mass units per square pixel. Defaults to 1.
  If density is `infinity`, then the object can move others
  but is not itself affected by collisions, and also ignores
  gravity.

`entity.spin`
: Scalar counter-clockwise rotational velocity. Defaults to 0.
  Has units of radians/frame by default.

`entity.torque`
: Scalar counter-clockwise rotational torque. Defaults to 0.
  Has units of mass * radians/frame^2 by default. Typical torques
  are on the scale 1-10.

`entity.vel`
: `xy()` linear velocity. Defaults to (0, 0).
  Has units of pixels/frame by default.

`entity.physics_sleep_state`
: Current sleeping state of the entity in a physics engine. Default is `"awake"`. Legal values are
  are `"sleeping"`, `"awake"`, and `"vigilant"` (awake and can never go to sleep). Because
  objects that are sleeping do not maintain contacts with other sleeping objects or parts of
  the environment, if you want to check for contacts (such as with the ground) on a player controlled
  entity then it should be `"vigilant"`.

`entity.restitution`
: Amount of energy preserved in a collision. Useful range is 0%-100%. The default is 10%.
  The net restitution applied between two entities is the geometric mean of their restitution values.

`entity.contact_category_mask`
: Contact (collision) categories for this object, as 32-bit flags.
  Two objects can only contact if
  `(A.contact_category_mask bitand B.contact_hit_mask) and (B.contact_category_mask bitand A.contact_hit_mask)`.
  Defaults to 1. Does not affect `overlaps()`.

`entity.is_sensor`
: If `true`, collisions will occur with this entity as usual but will not cause motion to change
  as a result, like a ghost. Default is `false`. This is useful for detecting triggers such as a character
  walking through a doorway or touching acid via the physics engine without causing that to affect
  the object. Note that a sensor must have infinite density or be attached to another object or it will
  fall out of the world by gravity. If you want to never register collisions, instead set `entity.contact_category_mask = 0`
  to prevent all collisions and preclude them being reported.

  Collision sensors have density, and it must be nonzero. Set their density
  to a small value, such as `epsilon`, to minimize the effect on the motion of other objects
  that they are attached to.

`entity.contact_group`
: An integer index of a group of other entities that this one should not collide with, regardless
  of the `contact_hit_mask` or `contact_category_mask`. Zero means no group at all. Defaults to 0.
  Does not affect `overlaps()`.

`entity.contact_hit_mask`
: See `entity.contact_category_mask`. Defaults to `0xffffffff`. Does not affect `overlaps()`.

`entity.stiction_factor`
: Multiplier applied to `entity.friction` in the static dry friction case
  when an object is at rest. Useful range is 0-10. Defaults to 1.

  The value 0 disables static friction (since it allows the object to immediately
  start moving, and thus have kinetic friction engage), so that only dynamic friction is applied.
  The net stiction_factor between two entities is the _maximum_ of each of their
  stiction_factor values. Set moving platforms and conveyor belts to have high stiction to help characters
  move with the surface that they are on.

`entity.friction`
: Kinetic dry friction applied when an object is in motion, damping the velocity.
  Useful range is 0%-100%. Defaults to 15%. The net friction applied between two
  entities is the geometric mean of their friction values.

`entity.drag`
: Drag friction applied when an object is moving freely. Useful range is 0-10. Defaults to 0.005.
  There is a single drag constant for the body independent of the orientation or direction of
  motion. This is not a drag _coefficient_ because it is independent of cross-sectional area.


### Hierarchy

The hierarchy is not a traditional scene graph. Children can opt to
either compose their properties with their ancestors recursively or
have absolute properties in draw space.

Hierarchy functions:

`entity_add_child(parent, child)`
: Adds the `child` entity to the `parent.child_array` and sets `child.parent = parent`.
  Removes the child from any previous parent's child array if there was one.
  Returns the `child`.

`entity_remove_child(parent, child)`
: Removes the `child` from `parent.child_array`, if it is a child. Does nothing if
  `child` is not in `parent`. Causes an error if `child` and `parent.child_array`
  are inconsistent.  If the child was added by the `make_entity` `childTable` as a
  field on parent, that field is not modified. You can remove the field explicitly
  using `remove_key(parent, "childName")`.

`entity_remove_all(parent)`
: Removes all children.

`entity_update_children(entity)`
: Recursively update the `pos`, `scale`, `angle`, and `offset` fields of all children and
  descendants from their `pos_in_parent`, `scale_in_parent`, `angle_in_parent`, and `offset_in_parent`
  fields. Usually called after simulation or animation processing.


The hierarchy properties are:

`entity.child_array`
: Array of other entities that position themselves relative to
  this one. Defaults to `[]`.

`entity.parent`
: Another entity that has this one as a child. Defaults to `nil`.

`entity.angle_in_parent`
: Scalar counter-clockwise angle in radians relative to the parent if
  `orient_with_parent` is true, otherwise ignored.

`entity.offset_in_parent`
: `xy()` `offset` relative to the parent in entity space if `offset_with_parent` is true,
  otherwise ignored.

`entity.offset_with_parent`
: Boolean. If true, then `entity_update_children()` recomputes `entity.offset` from `entity.offset_in_parent`
  and `parent.offset`.

`entity.pos_in_parent`
: `xy()` position value relative to the parent, in parent space. There is no way to opt out of this property being
  applied recursively. Defaults to (0, 0).

`entity.orient_with_parent`
: If true, `entity_update_children()` will override this entity's angle and scale with
  `entity.angle = entity.angle_in_parent + parent.angle` and `entity.scale = entity.parent.scale * entity.scale_in_parent`.

`entity.scale_in_parent`
: `xy()` scale relative to the parent axes for flipping
  the child if `scaleWithParent` is true, otherwise ignored.

`entity.z_in_parent`
: Scalar z value relative to the parent. There is no way to opt out of this property being
  applied recursively. Defaults to 0.


Physics
---------------------------------------------------------

You can implement your own physics simulation, use entity and the
entity helpers, enable the full entity physics engine, or mix these
techniques.

### Entity Helpers

Also see the Intersections section for computing your own collisions and
intersections.

`entity_apply_force(entity, world_force, world_pos (= entity.pos))`
: Apply world-space `world_force` to `entity` at world-space position `world_pos`,
  updating both `entity.force` and `entity.torque`. To apply
  a force at the center of mass, you can also directly add to `entity.force`.
  To apply a torque without a net force at the center of mass, directly
  add to `entity.torque`.

  Does not support entities with children or pivots.

`entity_apply_impulse(entity, world_impulse, world_pos (= entity.pos))`
: Apply world-space `world_impulse` (mass * velocity) to `entity` at world-space position `world_pos`,
  updating both `entity.vel` and `entity.spin`. To apply
  a velocity change at the center of mass, you can also directly add to `entity.vel`.
  To apply angular velicty without a net linear velocity impulse at the center of mass, directly
  add to `entity.spin`.

  Does not support entities with children or pivots.

`entity_area(e)`
: Returns the world space area of `e`, which must have `shape`
  and `size` properties and may have a `scale` property.

`entity_inertia(entity)`
: Scalar inertia tensor about the center of mass. Equal to
  `entity_mass(entity) * magnitude(entity.scale * entity.size)² / 12`
  when `shape` is `"rect"` and `⅛ entity_mass(entity) *
  (entity.scale.x * entity.size.x)²` when `entity.shape == "disk"`.
  Has units of mass * pixels^2.

`entity_mass(entity)`
: Scalar mass equal to the bounds area in pixels specified by the
  `entity.shape` and `entity.size` times the `entity.density`.
  Returns generic mass units.

`entity_move(entity, pos (= entity.pos), angle (= entity.angle))`
: Instantaneously moves an entity to this position and angle _as if it had
  naturally reached that location in the previous frame_, setting the appropriate
  `entity.vel` and `entity.spin`. This is useful for moving
  entities with infinite density in a way that causes them to interact
  naturally with other entities that they come into contact with.
  For example, use this function for implementing moving platforms,
  scripted set-piece animations, and elevators.

`entity_simulate(entity, t (= 1))`
: Computes `acc = force/mass; twist = torque/inertia` and
  `vel *= 1 - drag; spin *= 1 - drag`.  Then,
  integrates `acc` into `vel` into `pos` and `twist` into `spin` into
  `angle`. Finally, resets `force` and `torque` to zero and
  invokes `entityUpdateChilren()`.

  Uses a forward Euler (1st order Runge-Kutta) integrator over
  duration `t` measured in frames. This tends to be a more stable
  method for small, discrete time steps than the analytic quadratic
  solution and avoids the need for additional data of higher-order
  integrators.

  Does not perform collision detection or response, or enforce attachment
  constraints. You do not need to call `entity_simulate()` if you are
  already using `physics_simulate()`.

`make_contact_group()`
: Creates a unique value for an `entity.contact_group`.


### Intersections

These are methods for determining intersections and collisions explicitly, without
using the full physics engine.

`axis_aligned_draw_box(e)`
: Returns a box specified by `{pos:xy(), size:xy(), shape:"rect"}` that encloses
  the object `e` (and all of its children if it is an entity) in draw space.

`overlaps(A, B, recurse (= true))`
: Returns true if the bounds of `A` and `B` overlap each other, taking
  shape and orientation into account and incuding the borders. Ignores
  `offset` and `z` for entities. Each of `A` and `B` can be any of:

   - an entity from `make_entity()`
   - any object with `pos` and optional `shape`, `angle`, `pivot`, and `size` properties
   - an `xy()` point

  If `recurse` is true (the default), compares `A` and all of its children
  against `B` and all of its children. This is quadratic in the number of
  elements of each and can be slow for very deep entity hierarchies.

  See `entity.pivot`, `entity.shape`, etc. for discussion of how those properties
  affect the collision detection.

`ray_intersect(ray, obj)`
: The `ray` object must have `xy()` fields for `origin`, `direction`,
  and an optional number field for `length (= inf)`.
  The `ray.direction` will automatically be normalized.

  The `obj` has `shape`, `pos`, `size`, and optional `angle`
  properties (an entity satisfies this, but it doesn't have to be a full
  entity). If there is a `obj.child_array`, then that is recursively
  processed and the first intersection encountered is returned.

  Returns the object hit or `nil` if there was no intersection.
  The `ray.length` is shortened to the hit distance.

`ray_intersect(ray, array)`
: Returns the first object intersected when calling `ray_intersect(ray, array[i])`
  on each element of the array.

<!--
`rayIntersectMap(args)`
: Calls `rayIntersectMap()` with the named arguments.

`rayIntersectMap(ray, map, tileCanBeSolid (= get_map_sprite), pixelIsSolid (= ∅), layer (= 0), replacement_array (= []))`
: The `ray` object must have `xy()` fields for `origin`, `direction`,
  and an optional number field for `length (= inf)`.
  The `ray.direction` will automatically be normalized. The ray is in _draw coordinates_.

  Returns the sprite hit or `nil` if there was no intersection.
  The `ray.length` is shortened to the hit distance.

  `def tileCanBeSolid(map, P, layer, replacement_array)` returns true
  if the tile at `P` _in map coords_ can trigger a collision. The
  callback `pixelIsSolid` is then invoked to find the collision within
  the tile. The default value returns true for any non-`nil` tile.

  `def pixelIsSolid(map, P, layer, replacement_array)` returns true if the pixel at `P` _in map coords_
  triggers a collision.  The default value, returns true for all pixels,
  so that any `tileCanBeSolid() == true` tile immediately stops the ray. See `get_map_pixel_color()`.
  As an example of a common alternative, `def pixelIsSolid(map, P, L, R): return get_map_pixel_color(map, P, L, R).a > 50%`
  causes collisions with any 50% opaque pixels.
-->


### Engine

The full physics engine provides collision detection, response, and
constraints.

Children of entities in the physics system have no effect on physics. In future
releases they will affect the collision shape, moment of inertia, and mass.

While an entity is in a physics context, the following properties may
not be changed on that entity:

- `shape`
- `size`
- `pivot`, which must always be `xy(0,0)`
- `scale`, except for sign changes

Attachments not moved for scale changes because it is ambiguous how
the attached object should be changed. If you need attachments on
entities that change scale signs, then detach the two entities, move
them, and create a new attachment in the new position.  For example,
when a character flips direction and a rope tied to their hand should
now be on the other side.

Changing the `contact_group`, `contact_hit_mask`, or
`contact_category_mask` on the bodies in an attachment with `collide = false`
after the attachment been created may cause the attached bodies
to start colliding with each other.

`make_physics(options (= {}))`
: Create and return a new physics context. There can be multiple, independent physics contexts
  in the game. Each entity may only be in one physics context at a time.
  The options are:

  - `gravity (= xy(0, -up_y()))`: Default gravitational acceleration on all objects.
    Set to `xy(0,0)` and explicitly apply gravity if your game is not set on a planetary
    surface or requires excluding most objects from gravity.
  - `allowSleeping (= true)`: Allow simple rigid bodies to fall "asleep" and stop simulating
    until touched. This dramatically increases simulation performance, however some entities
    will fail to properly waken when the object supporting them is removed and can remain
    floating in the air.

`physics_add_contact_callback(physics, callback, min_depth (= 0), max_depth (= ∞), contact_mask (= 0xffffffff), sensors (= "exclude"))`
: Adds a callback that processes collisions (new contacts) at the end of `physics_simulate()`.
  If either entity in the collision has a `entity.contact_category_mask` that intersects the `contact_mask`
  and the collision has `depth &gt;= min_depth`, then invoke
  `callback({entityA, entityB, depth, age, point0, point1, normal})`.
  `point1` may be `nil`. `normal` is in draw coordinates and
  always points out of `entityA`.

  `depth` is a coarse measure of how hard the objects hit each other. It has
  a useful scale from 0-4.

  This is good for triggering particle effects or sound on collisions,
  or causing damage to objects. When doing so, use the parameters to filter:
  for example, `min_depth` = 1 will only trigger on significant,
  new contacts. There is no way to remove a contact callback.

`physics_entity_has_contacts(physics, entity, child_region (= ∅), world_normal (= ∅), mask (= 0xffffffff), sensors (= "exclude"))`
: Returns true if `physics_entity_contacts()` would produce any contacts with the same arguments.
  This is more efficient, for the case where the actual contacts are not needed.

`physics_entity_contacts(physics, entity, child_region (= ∅), world_normal (= ∅), mask (= 0xffffffff), sensors (= "exclude"))`
: Returns an array of all current contacts, where each contact has the form
  `{entityA, entityB, depth, point0, point1, normal}`. The contact points are
  in draw coordinates.

  The region, mask, normal, and sensors setting are used to filter the contacts
  returned. A contact must have nonzero `contact_mask bitand
  otherEntity.contact_category_mask` for the _other_ entity
  involved. The average position of point0 and point1 must also lie
  within the `child_region`, which is in the entity's reference frame.
  `child_region` is either `nil` (all contacts) or an argument suitable
  for passing to `overlaps()`. If `normal` is specified, then the
  contact normal for the other entity must point within ±80° degrees of
  this vector. This is a draw-space vector. `sensors` may be `"include"`,
  `"exclude"`, or `"only"` (exclusively return contacts with sensors).

  In the returned contacts, the `entity` may be either `entityA` or `entityB`.

  This function is ueseful for determining if entities are currently
  in resting contact, such as whether a character is standing on the
  ground and can jump. In that case, make the `child_region` a box around the
  character's feet and set the `world_normal` to the up vector for the world.
  The `child_region` may have to be very wide (e.g., 2x as wide as the character)
  to encompass locations where contact was briefly made in a previous frame.

  Note that sleeping entities have no contacts.
  See also `physics_add_contact_callback()`.

`physics_add_entity(physics, entity)`
: Add `entity` to this physics context. An entity may only be in
  one physics context at a time. Returns the `entity`.

  Once an entity is added to the physics system, it will be retained
  in the physics system until `physics_remove_entity()` is called.
  Use the `draw_physics()` command or IDE button to debug physics objects
  that correspond to entities which are no longer being drawn.

`physics_attach(physics, type, {entityA, entityB, pointA, pointB, collide (= ∅), ...})`
: Attaches two entities to each other, `entityB` to the
  world. `entityA` may be `nil` (the world) or have infinite
  density. `entityB` must be non-`nil` and have finite density. The
  points are optional attachment points in the reference frame of each
  entity.  The attachment points do not have to be within the bounds
  of the entities. The entities are immediately moved to satisfy the constraint
  of the attachment.

  Two entities may not have multiple attachments directly between them. Doing
  so will cause unstable and undefined behavior.

  _There is no relationship to the entity parent/child hierarchy_. Entity children
  are used for explicit positioning. Attachments are for letting simulation position
  objects.

  Returns an attachment object, which can be passed to `physics_detach()`.

  All attachment types are massless, except for weld, which adds a slight amount of
  mass at the weld point and thus affects net mass and moment of inertia.

  If `collide` is false, then the entities cannot collide with each other while
  the attachment is maintained. The default for `collide` is `true` for spring, rope, and rod
  attachments and `false` for all other types.  You can also disable collisions by putting
  the objects in the same `entity.contact_group`, which is more efficient.

  Attached entities cannot sleep.

  The supported values of `type` and the additional named parameters supported for each are:

   - `"pin"`:    This kind of attachment is referred to in other APIs as a revolute joint.
   - `"spring"`: `length (= ‖pointB - pointA‖)`, `stiffness (= 0.5%)`, `damping (= 0.2%)`
   - `"rod"`:    `length (= ‖pointB - pointA‖)`
   - `"weld"`:   `angle (= entityB.angle - entityA.angle)`. Rigid attachment with
                 the specified relative angle. <!-- It is more stable and efficient to
                 call `physics_remove_entity(physics, entityB)` and `entity_add_child(entityA, entityB)`
                 than to weld within the physics system. --> Requires `entityA` to be non-`nil`.
   - `"gyro"`:   `angle (= 0)` Free translation, but frozen rotation relative to each other.
     Useful for keeping characters upright. `entityA` must be `nil`. This kind of
     attachment is referred to in other APIs as a Cartesian joint or generalized 2D prismatic joint.
   <!--
   - `"hinge"`:  `minAngle`, `maxAngle`. If the hinge is unconstrained, use a pin.
   - `"rope"`:   `length`. If the rope will always be under tension, use a rod.
   - `"joint"`:  `minAngle`, `maxAngle`, `angle`, `stiffness (= 100%)` -->

`physics_detach(physics, attachment)`
: Remove this attachment, which was previously created by `physics_attach()`.

`physics_remove_all(physics)`
: Remove all entities and attachments from this physics context.

`physics_remove_entity(physics, entity)`
: Remove `entity` and all attachments for it from the physics context.
  See also `physics_add_entity()`.

`physics_simulate(physics, frames (= 1))`
: Simulate physics for this many frames, treating all forces and torques
  as constant over that period. Automatically calls `entity_update_children()`
  on all entities in the context. See also `entity_simulate()`.


Graphics
---------------------------------------------------------


### Colors

`gray(n)`
: Returns `rgb(n, n, n)`, with `n` clamped to [0, 1].

`gray(color)`
: Returns `rgb(n, n, n)`, with `n` equal to a perceptually-weighted average of the rgb values from color.
  The RGB --> gray conversion algorithm weights will likely change in a future release.

`hsva(h, s, v, a (= 1))`
: Returns an object with field `h` _wrapped_ to [0, 1], and fields `s`, `v`, and `a` clamped to [0, 1].

`hsv(h, s, v)`
: Returns an object with field `h` _wrapped_ to [0, 1], and fields `s` and `v` clamped to [0, 1].
  `h=0` and `h=1` are red, `h=1/3` is green, and `h=2/3` is blue, with values inbetween
  interpolated.

`rgb(hsvValue)`
: Convert the hsv result to rgba.

`rgb(r, g, b)`
: Create a structure with fields `r`, `g`, and `b` clamped to [0, 1].

`rgb_to_xyz(c)`
: Returns `{x: c.r, y: c.g, z: c.b}`.

`rgba(r, g, b, a (= 1))`
: Create a structure with fields `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` clamped to [0, 1].

`rgba(hsvaValue)`
: Convert the hsv result to rgba.


Colors can also be constructed using the syntax of HTML hexadecimal colors (which are also
shown in Photoshop and other drawing programs) using the syntax:

- #RRGGBBAA
- #RRGGBB
- #RGBA
- #RGB
- #LL (gray)
- #L (gray)

For example, `#F08` is equivalent to `rgb(1, 0, 0.5333)` and `#CC` is
equivalent to `gray(0.8039)`.

     --------------------------------------------------

The quadplay✜ uses 4:4:4:4 RGBA color, for a total of 4096 different colors and
16 levels of transparency including fully-transparent.

It can draw perfect 16-shade gradients of red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, and gray,
where the darkest shade of each of those is black.

Blending is based on z-order, not draw order, and is always the Porter-Duff
over-compositing rule:

 `result.r = back.r * (1 - front.a) + front.r * front.a`

and so on for `g` and `b`. The runtime is free to implement this
blending exactly using sorted draw calls or an A-buffer, or to
approximate it with alpha-to-coverage and multisampling or
fixed-memory order-independent pixel shading techniques. Blending
guarantees at least five bits per channel of intermediate precision
and four bits per channel of framebuffer storage, but implementations
may use more.

Colors are specified as objects that have either `r`, `g`, and `b`;
or `h`, `s`, and `v` fields, and an optional `a` field. All color
channels are on the range 0-1 and snapped to discrete
values. Additional fields in color objects are ignored.

Many routines accept both a "fill" color for the interior and a "border" color for the
perimeter.  Set either to transparent (`nil`) to efficiently disable that portion of rendering.

The `nil` value is transparent.


Borders are drawn inside shape coordinate boundaries and on top of fills, so a transparent
border is identical to a border that is the same color as the fill. Shapes include their
endpoints and borders.


### Drawing

`draw_poly(args)`
: Named argument version of `draw_poly()`.

`draw_poly(vertex_array, color, outline = (nil), pos (= xy(0, 0)), angle (= 0), scale (= xy(1, 1)), z (= 0))`
: Draws the _convex_ polygon defined by the `vertex_array`, first scaling by `scale`, rotating by `angle`,
  and then translating by `pos`. The polygon may have any winding direction. The outcome of the drawn result
  is undefined and may change across platforms if the polygon is not convex (but there will never be an error).

`draw_corner_rect(corner, size, color, outline (= ∅), z (= 0))`
: Draw a rectangle covering all of the pixel centers between `corner`
  and `corner + size`. This is primarily for UI window drawing.
  `size` may be negative.

  If the top or right
  sides exactly touch a pixel center (at a half-integer), then they do
  not cover it. The direction in which the `size` applies is determined
  by the current transform. Note that if `up_y()` is positive, then
  the rectangle will extend _upward_ from the corner.

  See also `draw_rect()`.

`draw_disk(args)`
: Object version of `draw_disk()`.

`draw_disk(pos, r, color, outline, z (= 0))`
: Draw a circle or filled disk centered at (`pos.x`, `pos.y`)
  with radius `r` and z-order `z`.

`draw_line(args)`
: Named argument version of `draw_line()`.

`draw_line(A, B, color, z (= 0), width (= 1))`
: Draw a 1-pixel line from (`A.x`, `A.y`) to (`B.x`, `B.y`) using z-order `z`.
  When using the default transformation, put the endpoints at half-pixel
  positions for the best alignment with the pixel grid.

`draw_point(args)`
: Named argument version of `draw_point()`.

`draw_point(pos, color, z (= 0))`
: Set the color of pixel (`pos.x`, `pos.y`) to color `color` with z-order `z`.
  A series of `draw_point` calls with the same `z` value are about twice as
  fast as ones with mixed `z` values or intermixed with other draw calls.
  For the best alignment under the default transformation, put the endpoints
  at half-pixel positions.

`draw_previous_mode()`
: Re-issue all of the drawing commands from the previous mode's frame
  that completed before the `set_mode()` call. These are not
  affected by the current `clip` or `transform`. The calls are in full
  2.5D, so calls from this mode may insert graphics between them in
  the z-order.  Useful for drawing the main game background during
  inventory, pause, menu, and dialogue modes.

`draw_rect(args)`
: Named argument version of `draw_rect()`.

`draw_rect(pos, size, color, outline (= ∅), angle (= 0), z (= 0))`
: Draws the rectangle _centered_ at `pos` with the given `size` and `angle`.
  No `scale` argument is provided because it is easy for the caller to
  explicitly multiply `size` by `scale`.
  See also `draw_corner_rect()` and `draw_sprite_corner_rect()`.

`draw_sprite(args)`
: Keyword version of `draw_sprite()`. Pass an object that has properties
  whose names match the arguments of the positional version. For example,
  `draw_sprite({sprite: wizard, pos: xy(100, 100), z: 2})`.
  Values default according to the positional argument version.

`draw_sprite(sprite, pos, angle (= 0), scale (= ∅), opacity (= 1), z (= 0), override_color (= ∅))`
: Draw sprite `sprite` with its center at `pos`. `pos` must have at
  least `x` and `y` fields. The sprite appears at `z` in the z-order
  (defaults to 0). The `scale` parameter must be nil (which is treated
  as `xy(1,1)`), a number that is not zero, or an `xy()` with nonzero fields.  Scale is applied before the sprite is
  rotated.  Sprites are not flipped or scaled by `set_transform`
  values, but the rotation and center are affected by the
  `set_transform` scaling.

  If it is not `nil`, the `override_color` blends into the red, green, and blue
  values read from each pixel of the sprite based on its own alpha. The alpha value
  of the result is the sprite's original alpha value. Useful for simulating lighting,
  turning a sprite into a shadow silhouette, or flashing a sprite a different color
  to indicate hits or invincibility.

`draw_sprite_corner_rect(sprite, corner, size, z ( = 0))`
: Draw a rectangle enclosing points `corner` and `corner+size`
  filled with `sprite` tiled as needed (and aligned to the
  center), and surrounded by the neighbors of `sprite`
  in its spritesheet. The edges surround the specified coordinates.
  Used for drawing user interface elements (GUI) of dynamic size such as
  windows and health bars.  Keep in mind that some artwork is designed
  to only be stretched in one dimension, or to tile only at integer
  multiples.

  See also `draw_corner_rect()` and `draw_rect()`.
  
  This routine ignores the global camera. That may change before SDK version 1.0.

`draw_text(args)`
: Keyword version of `draw_text()`. Pass an object that has properties
  whose names match the arguments of the positional version. For example,
  `draw_text({text: "Fire!", pos: xy(100, 100), x_align:"left", z: 2})`.
  Values default according to the positional argument version.

`draw_text(font, text, pos, color (= ∅), shadow (= ∅), outline (= ∅), x_align (= "left"), y_align (= "baseline"), z (= 0), wrap_width (= ∅), text_size (= size(text)), markup (= false))`
: Print string `text` relative to `pos`. Returns an `xy()` size of the
  bounding box, excluding shadows and outline. This bounding box is
  conservative in height and accounts for the highest ascender and
  accent and lowest descender.  It is tight in width and tailored to
  the exact characters. The bounding box also does not include the
  spacing that should be added between consecutive lines. Use
  `font.line_height` to know how far to place separate lines
  vertically or simply use strings with `"\n"` characters in them to
  print multiple lines. _This return value will change in a future implementation._
  
  The positioning of text will follow the transform and camera, but
  individual letters always draw upright and 1:1 pixel perfect,
  without flipping, rotation, or scaling, no matter what the transform
  or camera are.

  x-alignment of `-1` or `"left"` = left,
  `0` or `"center"` = center, `+1` or `"right"` = right,
  y-alignment of `-1` or `"top"` = top, `0` or `"center"` = center,
  `1` or `"baseline"` = baseline, `2` or `"bottom"` = bottom.
  For multiline strings, alignment only applies to the first line 
  in the current version. _This will change in a future implementation._
  

  `font` must be loaded from the assets.  Color,
  shadow, and outline default to transparent. Any non-transparent
  outline causes the shadow to move below both the outline and main color.
  Returns the line height (including spacing) for the next line.  
  
  If `wrap_width` is specified, breaks the text at the maximum width
  and renders multiple lines. Each line is offset by the font's
  vertical spacing and aligned as specified. See also `text_width()`.

  `text_size` restricts draw_text to only printing that many characters,
  *after* word-wrapping. This allows gradually revealing text in a stable
  way under word wrap.

  `markup = true` enables special syntax for changing the style within
  a single string and removes single linebreaks. The markup syntax is `"...{property:value text...}..."`.
  The valid property names are `color`, `font`, `shadow`, and `outline`.
  That property is valid from the beginning brace to the end one. Only
  one property can be changed per brace, and braces can be nested.
  For strings that word wrap, the vertical spacing of lines is based
  on the original font specified as an argument to `draw_text()`, so
  using very different fonts can result in poorly formatted output.
  The legal values are colors specified using `rgba()`, `rgb()`, `hsva()`,
  `hsv()`, or `gray()` with numbers, the `#` color syntax, or the
  names of constants specified in the `game.json` file. Variables
  and expressions are not permitted in the values. To insert a regular
  brace within markup, use a slash escape, which must be typed in a string
  using a double slash: `\\{` or `\\}`. 

`draw_tri(args)`
: Named argument version of `draw_tri()`.

`draw_tri(A, B, C, color, outline (= ∅), pos (= xy(0, 0)), scale (= xy(1, 1)), angle (= 0), z (= 0))`
: Scale `A`, `B`, and `C` by `scale`, rotate them around the origin by `angle`, translate
  by `pos`, and then draw the triangle. The `pos` argument is not first because in many
  cases this is called with draw-space vertices and no translation. The triangle may have
  any winding direction.

`get_background()`
: Returns the value previously set with `set_background()`.

`get_clip()`
: Returns the current net clipping region as an object that
  can be passed to `set_clip()`.

`get_sprite_pixel_color(sprite, pos, result (= ∅))`
: Returns the color of pixel `pos` in the sprite as an `rgba`
  value. When `result` is not `nil`, it is used to store the result
  to avoid memory allocation. If the pixel is out of bounds for that sprite,
  returns `nil` if there is no `result` specified and `rgba(0,0,0,0)`
  in `result` otherwise.

`intersect_clip(args)`
: Object version of `intersect_clip()`.

`intersect_clip(pos (= ∅), size (= ∅), z (= ∅), z_size (= ∅))`
: Intersect the current clipping region with this new one. Ignores the
  current transformation.

`reset_clip()`
: Reset to the default clipping region, `set_clip(xy(0, 0), SCREEN_SIZE, -2047, 4096)`.

`set_background(color (= #0))`
: Replace the background with this color. The background is automatically
  drawn each frame with the last value set.

`set_background(sprite)`
: Replace the background with this sprite, which must be the exact size of
  the screen and in a spritesheet that is the exact size of the screen.

`set_clip(args)`
: Object version of `set_clip()`.

`set_clip(pos (= ∅), size (= ∅), z (= ∅), z_size (= ∅))`
: Set the clipping region to this region. Unspecified and `nil` values
  retain their current value. `pos` is the upper-left corner. 
  `pos` and `size` must be `nil` or `xy()` values.
  Coordinates are clamped to the physical
  screen and z to the range [-2047, 2048]. `size` and `z_size` may be
  negative. It is impossible to set a clipping region smaller than
  1x1x1 pixels.

`text_width(font, s, markup (= false))`
: Returns the pixel width of string `s` in this font, including border padding.
  Note that leading and trailing numbers may incur additional empty space for
  column alignment. If `markup` is true, then `s` is processed using the
  markup rules from `draw_text()`.

`xy(x, y)`
: Create a structure with values `x` and `y`, which can be used with most drawing routines.

`xyz(x, y, z)`
: Create a structure with values `x`, `y`, and `z`, which can be used with most drawing routines.

### Post Effects

The final image drawn can be transformed in limited ways during scan
out to the display, as if it were a sprite being drawn to the screen.
Setting any post effects may slow down rendering slightly.

`get_post_effects()`
: Return the current post effects in a form that can be passed to `set_post_effects()`.

`set_post_effects(args)`
: The arguments have the following fields, all optional. nil values default to their previous value.
  Invoke `reset_post_effects()` first for a clean set.

  - `background` is an `rgba()` to draw in the background behind the new frame. The `a` component
    controls how opaque the background is. Setting `background.a = 0` allows new frames to be blended on
    top of old ones for a motion blur effect.
  - `color` is an `rgba()` to combine with the the new frame before it is composited. Setting the `a`
    to 0 disables the color.
  - `blendMode` is one of the following strings: `"source-over"`, `"difference"`, `"hue"`, `"multiply"`
    describing how the `color` affects the frame.
  - `scale` is an `xy` for how to stretch the new frame
  - `angle` is a counter-clockwise angle in radians to rotate the image about its center by
  - `pos` is an `xy` translation from the center, with +y = down
  - `opacity` is the amount of opacity to use for the new frame. If `background.a` and `opacity` are
    both less than 1 then the new and previous frames blend together

`reset_post_effects()`
: Restore the defaults, which directly composite each frame.


Map
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A map asset has the following fields. Its sprite elements are mutable at runtime:

`map[x][y]`
: The sprite at `x, y` in integer map coordinates in layer 0, or `nil` if empty.

`map.layer[L]`
: A 2D array of the contents of layer `L`.

`map.layer[L][x][y]`
: The sprite at `x`, `y` in layer `L`, or `nil` if empty.
  See `unpackSpriteIndex`. The elements *can* be changed at runtime.

`map.size`
: `xy()` size in map coordinates (not pixels).

`map.spritesheet_table`
: A table mapping TMX tile set names to spritesheets for this map.

`map.sprite_size`
: The `xy()` size of source sprites in pixels.

`map.wrap_x`
: If true, the map wraps horizontally. Array access does not automatically
  wrap, but function such as `draw_map()`, `find_map_path()`, and `get_map_pixel_color()`
  will implement wrapping.

`map.wrap_y`
: If true, the map wraps vertically. Array access does not automatically
  wrap, but function such as `draw_map()`, `find_map_path()`, and `get_map_pixel_color()`
  will implement wrapping.

`map.z_offset`
: Amount to add to each layer index when computing a z value for rendering.
  `layer = (z - map.z_offset) / map.z_scale`; `z = layer * map.z_scale + map.z_offset`.
  See also `transform_ws_to_map_space()` and `transform_map_space_to_ws()`.

`map.z_scale`
: Amount to multiply each layer index to compute a z value for rendering.
  `layer = (z - map.z_offset) / map.z_scale`; `z = layer * map.z_scale + map.z_offset`.
  See also `transform_ws_z_to_map_layer()` and `transform_map_layer_to_ws_z()`.


The following functions relate maps, pixels, and sprites. In them, a
"pixel coordinate" is in the _pre-transformed_ space in which graphics
commands operate and a "map coordinate" is in the space of the map
indices. The map's z-axis corresponds to layers.

`draw_map(args)`
: Draw the map using the named argument object.

`draw_map(map, min_layer (= 0), max_layer (= length(map.layer)), replacement_array (= ∅), pos (= xy(0, 0)), angle (= 0), scale (= xy(1, 1)), z (= 0))`
: Draws the map with the current transform.  If there is no transform,
  the map is drawn with the first tile's center at (0, 0), which means
  that the tile will be half off the screen.  If specified, `min_layer`
  and `max_layer` determine the inclusive range of layers to draw.  Map
  rendering ignores skew transformations...typically the skew will be
  implicit in the map's layout and rendering.

  If `replacement_array` is specified, it must be an even length array
  of the form `[from0, to0, from1, to1, ...]`.  Each `from` value is a
  sprite in the map. It will be replaced during drawing with the
  corresponding `to` value. The `to` values may also be `nil`.

  The if specified in the source `.json` file, the map will wrap
  appropriately horizontally or vertically when drawn, if it is large
  enough to covers at least 1/3 of the current clipping area.
  
  The `pos`, `angle`, and `scale` apply the position of the map as if
  it was a giant object, with the origin centered at the center of
  tile (0, 0).  Using a non-default `angle` and `scale` will
  approximately double the cost of drawing the map.

`find_map_path(map, startXY, goalXY, edgeCost, costLayer = 0)`
: Specialized version of `find_path` for maps. The start and end positions
  are rounded down to the nearest integer map coordinates. The `edgeCost`
  is either a function or an array. The function returns an array of
  map coordinates to visit or `nil` if no traversable path exists.

  The function version is `def edgeCost(A, B, map)`. It returns the
  cost of traversing from `A` to `B` in the map, where each is an
  `xy()`. That cost should always be nonnegative. It should be 1 for a
  typical edge, `infinity` for an edge that is not traversable, and
  higher or lower than 1 for edges of varying difficulty such as
  walking through rough terrain or downhill.

  The array version of `edgeCost` is an array of pairs of the form
  `[sprite0, cost0, sprite1, cost1, ...]`. Each cost corresponds to
  entering that sprite on `map.layer[costLayer]`. These are the `B`
  values from `edgeCost`. Sprites that are not specified in the array
  cost 1 to traverse, and it costs `infinity` to leave the map bounds.

`get_map_pixel_color(map, map_coord, layer (= 0), replacement_array (= ∅))`
: Returns the color of the pixel in `map` at the corresponding
  `map_coord` and `round(layer)`. Returns `nil` for out of
  bounds values and empty sprites. See also
  `get_map_pixel_color_by_ws_coord()`.

`get_map_pixel_color_by_ws_coord(map, ws_coord, ws_z (= 0), replacement_array (= ∅))`
: Returns the pixel color in `map` at the corresponding `draw_coord`
  and `ws_z` using `transform_ws_to_map_space()`. The result is guaranteed
  to match what was drawn by `draw_map()`. Returns `nil` for out of
  bounds values and empty sprites. See also `get_map_pixel_color()`.

`get_map_sprite(map, map_coord, layer (= 0), replacement_array (= ∅))`
: Returns the sprite in `map` at the corresponding `map_coord` and
  `layer` using rounding. Returns `nil` for out of bounds values. See
  also `get_map_sprite_by_ws_coord()`.

`get_map_sprite_by_ws_coord(map, ws_coord, ws_z (= 0), replacement_array (= ∅))`
: Returns the sprite in `map` at the corresponding `draw_coord` and
  `ws_z` using `transform_ws_to_map_space()` and rounding to compute the
  coordinates. Returns `nil` for out of bounds values. See also
  `get_map_sprite()`.

`set_map_sprite(map, map_coord, sprite, layer (= 0))`
: Sets the corresponding map sprite. Does nothing if `map_coord` is out of bounds.

`set_map_sprite_by_ws_coord(map, draw_coord, sprite, ws_z (= 0))`
: Sets the corresponding map sprite. Does nothing if `draw_coord` is out of bounds.

`transform_ws_to_map_space(map, ws_point)`
: Returns the _fractional_ map coordinates of `ws_point`.  See also
  `transform_map_space_to_ws()`.
  
  To account for a map that is rendered by `draw_map()` with its own `pos`, `angle`, and `scale`, use
  `transform_ws_to_map_space(map, transform_to(pos, angle, scale, ws_coord))`.

`transform_ws_z_to_map_layer(map, ws_z)`
: Using the current transformation, returns the _fractional_ map layer
  of `z`.

`transform_map_layer_to_ws_z(map, L)`
: Returns the `z` value that will be used for `map` under the current
  transformation.

`transform_map_space_to_ws(map, map_coord)`
: Returns the draw coordinates of `map_coord`. Integer map_coords correspond to the centers of tiles,
  which will be fractional pixels for even map tile sizes. See also `transform_ws_to_map_space()`
  and `get_map_pixel_color()`.
  
  To account for a map that is rendered by `draw_map()` with its own `pos`, `angle`, and `scale`, use
  `transform_from(pos, angle, scale, transform_map_space_to_ws(map, map_coord))`.


Frame Hooks
----------------------------------------------------------

Frame hooks are useful for registering animation callbacks that happen
at the beginning of every frame or after a set number of frames.

The order of execution between frame hooks is undefined and can change
as hooks expire. The transform for a frame hook is whatever was set at
the end of the previous frame.

When drawing, use `z` arguments to ensure that drawn objects overlap
in the desired order regardless of the order in which drawing executes.

`add_frame_hook(callback, end_callback, frames, run_in_mode (= get_mode()))`
: Register a `callback` function to run every frame for the given number of 
  `frames`.  The return value of `add_frame_hook()` is a hook that can be
  passed to `remove_frame_hook()`.

  - `callback`: `def callback(framesleft, total_frames)`, runs every frame. `framesleft`
    will be `total_frames - 1` on the first frame and `0` on the last one.
    This argument may be `nil`. If the callback returns `true`, the hook
    is removed without running the `end_callback`, otherwise it keeps running.
  - `end_callback`: `def end_callback()`, runs on the last frame. Can be `nil`.
  - `frames`: Number of frames to run for. May be `inf`.
  - `run_in_mode`: Only execute while the game is in this mode. Use `nil` to
    run in every mode.

  See also `sequence()` and `delay()` for common cases.

`delay(callback, delay_frames)`
: Same as `add_frame_hook(nil, callback, delay_frames or 0)`.

`remove_frame_hook(hook)`
: Remove this frame hook immediately, without executing its `end_callback`.
  If the hook has already ended or is not present, nothing happens.

`remove_frame_hooks_by_mode(mode)`
: Remove all frame hooks that are locked to the `mode`. Use `nil` to
  remove all hooks with no mode at all. Do not invoke the
  `endCallback`s on these hooks.

`sequence(...)`
: Add a series of frame hooks that run in the current mode. Returns a master
  hook that can be used with `remove_frame_hook()` to cancel the entire sequence.
  Each argument may be either a function, `nil`, or `{callback: function, frames: number}`.
  The callbacks run for the specified number of `frames`. If not `nil`, the callback
  signature is `def callback(framesleft, total_frames)`.
  Example: `sequence(drawExplosion, {callback: drawFire, frames: 20}, {callback: drawSmoke, frames: 4}, cleanup)`.
  Note that for convenience, `sequence(...array)` will take the arguments from an array instead of as separate
  parameters.



Time
----------------------------------------------------------

Quadplay always runs your `frame` event code at 60 fps. You can
hardcode this assumption into your program. For example, the built-in
simulation routines all use "frame" as the unit of time (and "pixel"
as the unit of distance). 

The _display_ may not refresh at 60 fps if
your program is consuming too much computation, because the runtime
will start dropping graphics calls to maintain the simulation rate.
It will scale all the way down to 12 fps on refresh while still
trying to execute your main loop at 60 fps so that simulation is
unaffected. 

`game_frames`
: Number of elapsed 1/60 frames since the program started. The program may
  mutate this global variable.

`mode_frames`
: Number of elapsed 1/60 frames since the current mode was most recently entered.
  The program may mutate this global variable.

`now()`
: Returns a time in seconds that is accurate to at least one millisecond.
  The origin for the time is arbitrary but constant per program run.
  Do not use this time for simulation because it will have inconsistent
  jumps between frames dues to frame rate scaling.

`local_time()`
: Returns an object with the following properties, set in the current time zone:

  - `year`, e.g., 2019
  - `month` 0-11
  - `day` 1-31
  - `hours` 0-23
  - `minute` 0-59
  - `second` 0-59
  - `millisecond` 0-999
  - `weekday` 0-6, where 0 = Sunday
  - `daySecond` seconds since midnight, including a fractional part
  - `timezone` minutes from UTC

  See `format_number()` for the various clock formatting options for numbers in seconds,
  and `now()` for a high-precision timer.

Path Finding
----------------------------------------------------------

`find_path(start_node, goal_node, estimate_path_cost, edge_cost, get_neighbors, node_to_ID, graph_obj (= ∅))`
: `find_path()` is a general-purpose path-finding routine for any kind of
  world representation. It uses the "A*" (A-star) algorithm. _See also `find_map_path()` for a simpler, map-specific version._

  The return value is an array of nodes to traverse to follow the shortest path discovered.
  The first node in the returned path will
  be the `start_node` and the last node will be the `goal_node`.
  `find_path()` will return `∅` if no path exists between the `start_node` and `goal_node`.

To recover the cost of the path, use the idiom:

````````````` PyxlScript
let cost = 0
for i < size(path) - 1: cost += edge_cost(path[i], path[i + 1])
`````````````

The arguments are below. See the example of using these on a map for a
better understanding of how they are typically computed.

`start_node`
: The starting location, in your chosen node representation.

`goal_node`
: The ending location, in your chosen node representation.

`estimate_path_cost(nodeA, nodeB, graph_obj)`
: Returns a numerical estimate of the cost for the path between
  `nodeA` and `nodeB`. For example, the straight line distance.
  The more accurate this estimate is, the faster that the algorithm
  will run. If it returns 0 for all inputs, then the algorithm
  will run in the worst case quadratic time but is guaranteed to find
  the exact shortest path instead of an approximation.

`edge_cost(nodeA, nodeB, graph_obj)`
: The actual cost of going from A to B, which are guaranteed to be
  neighbors.

`get_neighbors(node, graph_obj)`
: Returns an array of all neighbor nodes reachable from node. It is not required that
  neighbors are bidirectional. For example, a ledge may create an edge traversable
  in only one direction

`node_to_ID(node, graph_obj)`
: Returns a compact integer or string representation of the node, which is
  required internally by the algorithm for maintaining a table of nodes.

`graph_obj`
: Any object that represents your world graph. This can be `nil` if the other
  function arguments use global state.

### Map Example

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const sprite = map.spritesheet_table["mapTiles"]
const wall = sprite[0][0]
const swamp = sprite[0][1]
const dir = [xy(-1, 0), xy(0, -1), xy(0, 1), xy(1, 0)]

// Assume all edges cost 1
def estimate_path_cost(A, B, map): return |B.x - A.x| + |B.y - A.y|

// Moving through swamps is slow
def edge_cost(A, B, map): return 1 + (get_map_sprite(map, A) == swamp)

// Block traversal at map edges and walls
def get_neighbors(A, map):
   const neighbors = []
   for d in dir:
      const B = A + d; const s = get_map_sprite(map, B)
      if s and s != wall: push(neighbors, B)
   return neighbors

// Map to integer indices
def node_to_ID(A, map): return A.x + map.width * A.y

// In map coordinates
let start_node = xy(1, 1)
let goal_node = xy(20, 20)
let path = find_path(start_node, goal_node, estimate_path_cost, edge_cost, get_neighbors, node_to_ID, map)

// Print the path
for P in path: debug_print(P)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Debugging
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are provided for debugging and development support
only. They may do nothing on some platforms and may crash on others.
These APIs are subject to change. None of these are regular functions
or variables. They are special syntax that cannot be bound as values.

For enabling or disabling large sets of debugging statements at once in a
program, they can be masked using standard boolean operators. For example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Error on unimplemented routine
todo("Implement explosions")

// Only error if your own debug_graphics constant is true.
// You can change a constant from the IDE while the program
// is running!
debug_graphics and todo("Implement explosions")

// Error if running in the IDE using a local quadplay server
// and the current developer's local machine username is "stephan"
(IDE_USER == "stephan") and todo("Implement explosions")

// Only print if debug_graphics is true.
debug_graphics and debug_print("Running iteration" + i)

// Print when your own LOG_LEVEL constant is greater than 5
(LOG_LEVEL > 5) and debug_print("Simulating")

// Print when the 2nd bit of your own LOG_MASK constant 
// is set
(LOG_MASK bitand 0b010) and debug_print(format_number(x, "%"))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


`assert(x, msg (= "Assertion Failed"))`
: If `x` is true, does nothing. If `x` is false, creates the
  error `msg`. Assertions can be completely disabled
  from the Tools menu to make them have zero cost. In the current
  implementation, the `msg` is always evaluated when assertions
  are enabled even if the assertion test passes.

`debug_pause()`
: Pause program execution.

`debug_print(x, ...)`
: If `x` is a string, directly prints it to the Output window, otherwise
  prints `unparse(x)` to the Output window. When multiple arguments
  are provided they are processed individually with spaces between them.
  Debug print statements can be completely disabled from the Output
  window, which causes them to consume no processing time.

`debug_watch(expr)`
: Make the expression appear along with its value at the time that
  `debug_watch` executs in the Watch pane of the debugger. If there are
  multiple expressions that are syntactically identical, they will be
  collapsed and only the last to execute each frame will be
  shown. This is *not* a function. It is a special syntax. You may not
  pass the `debug_watch` command as if it were a function.


`draw_bounds(e, color (= gray(60%)), recurse (= true))`
: Render a debugging view of the bounds of an entity or other object `e`
  with `pos` and optional `angle`, `size`, `scale`, and `shape`
  properties. If `recurse` is true, descend into
  any `e.child_array` field.

`draw_physics(physics)`
: Render a debugging view of the physics system

`IDE_USER`
: A string constant bound to the `USER` environment variable for the operating
  system. This is "anonymous" when not running the IDE or a quadplay local
  server.

`todo`
: Same as `todo()`

`todo(message (= ""))`
: If todo errors are enabled in the IDE, reports the error `"Unimplemented: " + message`,
  otherwise does nothing.


Persistence
-----------------------------------------------------------

The local persistence API stores values in the browser's local
storage.  It is tied to a specific web browser and the URL from which
quadplay✜ is hosted, as well as the URL of the game. Some browsers will
automatically synchronize local storage across computers, however.

The storage API performs string manipulation and can be slow relative
to other commands. Avoid using it every frame.

This API is useful for save games, GUI state defaults, high scores,
and persistent worlds.


`load_local(key)`
: The key is loaded and deserialized with `parse()` to return an object
  that was previously saved with `save_local()`. If the `key` is not found,
  then `∅` is returned.

`save_local(key, value)`
: The value will be serialized to a string with `unparse()` and then
  stored associated with `key` and the URL of the game. Save a value
  of `∅` to delete the key. There is a maximum size of 2048
  characters for the unparsed value for each key and a maximum size of
  128 keys per application. There is no way for two different games to
  read each other's values.


Raw Device Access
-----------------------------------------------------------

`device_control(command, ...)`
: Reserved function for executing device-specific features such as the
  game launcher, GPIO, and alternative input devices. `command` is a
  string telling the host which control feature to execute, and the
  remaining arguments are passed to it. All `device_control()` commands
  may change in future releases and may not work on any given platform.

Intrinsics
-----------------------------------------------------------

quadplay✜ can execute about 10,000 vector operations per frame even
on embedded platforms. This is sufficient to program most mathematical
routines in a readable way and intrinsics are is not required.

For some _very_ math intensive routines, such as those with thousands
of particles, it is necessary to run slightly faster at the expense of
code that is harder to maintain. In these cases, use the function
calls below, which produce inline assembly instructions for the
quadplay✜ platform.

These calls have no argument checking. The vector functions execute
about twice as fast as regular overloaded operator arithmetic. The scalar
versions may be substantially faster than overloaded operators.

Intrinsics are never needed on literal values. `5 + 6` compiles to the
same code as `ADD(5, 6)`, for example. Intrinsics are not provided for
exponents, square root, bit shifts, trigonometric, modulo (remainder) 
and other operations that naturally compile with maximum efficiency.

Project File
=============================================================================================

Game JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project file is a JSON file describing all of the parts of the
program. The project file and all of its dependencies are reloaded
every time that you press play or reload in the IDE.

All of the `.game.json` properties can be modified through the user
interface in the IDE, except for the game constants. The only way
to modify constants in the current release is through an external
editor directly changing the `.game.json` file. Future releases
will provide a user interface for simple constants.

!!!
    quadplay✜ permits C++ style comments, hexadecimal numbers,
    IEEE 754 constants, raw decimals, leading plus signs, trailing commas,
    and multiline backquote JavaScript strings within JSON files for convenience when
    editing and debugging. This is not legal in strict JSON and
    may be incompatible with other tools. 

An example project is below, annotated with comments explaining the
options. Project files should have the double extension `.game.json`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each game must also contain:

- 64x64 `label64.png` box art image in the same folder as the `.game.json` file. This is
  used for display in the launcher.
- 128x128 `label128.png` box art image in the same folder as the `.game.json` file. This is
  not currently used.
- 1152x1120 `preview.png` image in the same folder as the `.game.json` file that contains
  6x10 frames of 192x112 video at 20 fps (3 seconds) used for the preview video in the launcher.

You can create the `preview.png` image by pressing Shift+F8 while your game is playing. It will
record 3s of video, process it to the correct resolution, and open it in a new browser tab.
Download this image, compress it as you would a sprite, and save it as your preview. Seek to keep
the total size around 100 kB for the image by choosing content that compresses well and using a good
compression tool. If the image is much larger, then there will be delay for players browsing
your game in the discover tab.



Constants
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike constants declared in code, the constants in the `.game.json` file appear in the IDE
in the project list and have GUI editors.

Each constant has the format `"..name..": {"type": "..type..", "value": ..., "description": "..."}`.
The `description` field is optional and the `raw` type permits a `url` instead of a `value`.
Other types may have additional metadata used for the IDE.

Explicit types allow support for the full PyxlScript literal syntax
beyond that permitted natively in JSON, appropriate GUI editors, and
annotations.

The available constants types are:

- `number`
  - Decimal number, with optional double quotes
  - Unicode fraction in double quotes
  - `"NaN"`
  - `"infinity"`, `"-infinity"`, `"∞"`, `"-∞"`
  - Number ending in `deg`, `°`, or `%`, all in double quotes
  - `"π"`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `nil` (no `value` needed)
- vectors
  - `xy`
  - `xz`
  - `xyz`
  - Each of these may have a `"nudge"` field, which is another vector of the same type
    that specifies the amount that the IDE should shift by along each axis when nudging.
    The nudge vector expects strings of numbers or numbers directly, rather than
    recursive fields with type and value elements.
- `rgb`
- `rgba`
- `hsv`
- `hsva`
- `raw`
  - Loaded from a json or yml file or inline as a json value. When in 
    an external file, must be at top level and not nested inside an array or object.
- `object`
- `array`
- `reference`
  - The value of a reference is the name of another constant or asset. These
    can be recursive, but obviously cannot form a cycle. References must be 
    defined at top level and not nested inside an array or object.
<!-- - `table` [tbd] -->

### `raw` Format

The `raw` format allows embedding a JSON-expressible value directly. `raw` format also
supports the format <code>{"type":"raw", "url": "</code><i>your url</i><code>"}</code> instead of an inline value.
The URL must be for a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) or [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file.
Note that the `raw` format is restricted to values that are expressible in those interchange
formats and does not support the full GUI editors and other format features.

`raw` type constants with URLs must be top-level constants. They
cannot be embedded within other constants. This is required in order
to separate the asynchronous loading from constant evaluation in the
implementation and to ensure that GUI editors can be built effectively
for objects and arrays.


Sprite JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sprite sheet JSON descriptor looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{
    "url":          "hero.png",
    "sprite_size":   {"x": 8, "y": 8},

    // Optional blank pixels between sprites. Default is zero.
    "gutter":       0,

    // Optional. Default is false. If true, indexing is transposed
    // in game.
    "transpose":    false,
    
    // Optional name of the file to load with an exsternal editor from the IDE
    // instead of the url one when editing. For example, if you export from
    // another tool such as Aseprite or Photoshop and would like to load *this*
    // instead from the IDE when editing the sprite.
    "source_url":   "hero.psd",

    // Default value for sprite.frames, the number of 1/60-second frames
    // to play a sprite during animation.
    "default_frames": 1,

    // Optional. Applies to pre-transpose coordinates. Each becomes
    // an array on the spritesheet with the extrapolate field set.
    // A name cannot be 'sprite_size' or any other spritesheet field.
    //
    // If an xy() is specified, creates a single sprite.
    //
    // If an object is specified, creates an array of sprites.
    //
    // If `extrapolate` is unspecified, defaults to looping.
    // `extrapolate` options are "loop", "oscillate", and "clamp"
    //
    // Each object may have its own `defaultFrames` that overrides the
    // spritesheet's defaultFrames, as well as a `frames` array with
    // one element per sprite in the animation.
    //
    // `end` defaults to `start`, and each field of `end` defaults
    // to the corresponding part of `start`.
    "names":        {
        "idle":     {"start": {"x": 0, "y": 0}, "end": {"x": 0, "y": 3}, "extrapolate": "oscillate",
                     "frames": [1, 2, 2, 1]},
        "run":      {"start": {"x": 1, "y": 0}, "end": {"y": 3}, "frames": 2},
        "jumpUp":   {"start": {"x": 2, "y": 0}},
        "jumpDown": {"start": {"x": 2, "y": 1}},
        "dead":     {"x": 3, "y": 0},
        "parachute":{"start": {"x": 3, "y": 1},
                     "pivot": {"x": 4, "y": 4}}
    },

    // Optional offset and extent. Using this conserves memory if the sprites
    // do not fill the entire PNG.
    "region":       {
        "pos":      {"x": 0, "y": 0}, // Optional, defaults to (0, 0)
        "size":     {"x": 128, "y": 32} // Optional, defaults to the remainder of the sheet
    },

    // Optional location on the sprites that aligns with (0, 0) in an entity's reference
    // frame. Defaults to the sprite size / 2.
    "pivot":        {"x": 4, "y": 7},

    // Optional license and copyright information.
    "license":      "GPL 3.0 (c) 2020 Morgan McGuire"
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will appear as the global variable `heroSpriteSheet` in memory,
which is a 2D array of individual sprites.

!!!
   I recommend a two-step process for compressing sprites to minimize loading time
   and game size.  First, use the quadplay✜ [Quantize✜](../tools/quantize.html)
   tool to reduce bit depth. Second, use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) (macOS),
   [PNGGauntlet](https://pnggauntlet.com/) (Windows), 
   [TriImage](https://trimage.org/) (Linux),
   or [PNG Crush online](https://richardassar.github.io/pngcrush.js/)
   to improve the PNG encoding.

For a sprite sheet named `S`, individual sprites are accessed as
`S[x][y]` in game. If the sprite sheet contains a single row, then
`S[x]` is sufficient. If there's a single image, just use `S`.

Setting `transpose` to true flips the indexing to `S[y][x]`, which
is more convenient for some sprites.

Animations appear to game code as arrays of sprites that have the
following additional fields:

`extrapolate`
: Equal to `"clamp"`, `"loop"`, or `"oscillate"` as specified in the spritesheet.

`frames`
: Equal to `infinity` for `"loop"` and `"oscillate"` animations and the total
  number of 60 Hz game frames of animation for finite `"clamp"` animations.

`period`
: Equal to `nan` for `"clamp"` animations and the number of 60 Hz game frames
  for one repeat of a `"loop"` or `"oscillate"` animation.

A game may use a total of **5,505,024 pixels** of sprite memory
(10.5 MB) across **128 sprite sheets** (including fonts), each no larger than
**1024x1024**.  You can allocate this however you wish within those
restrictions.  That's equivalent to 5,376 sprites at 32x32, 21,504
sprites at 16x16, or 64 full-screen images. These are of course soft
limits because you can modify the open source emulator to remove
them. The intent of the limits is to guarantee that your programs will
work on all future implementations of the runtime: web software,
Raspberry Pi, WebGL, GLES, and desktop OpenGL and Vulkan.

If the same sprite sheet is loaded by multiple `.sprite.json` files
using the same URL then it only counts once towards the resource
limits. This allows you to pack sprites with different sizes into the
same physical sheet at no penalty and treat them as different logical
sprite sheets.

There is no performance advantage or requirement for making sprites or
sprite sheets sizes even sizes or power of two sizes, although many
traditional sprites have sides of 8, 16, or 32 pixels. The quadplay✜
screen resolution is designed to allow an integer number of such
tiles.

You can use the Python script `tools/sprite_json_generator.py` to generate
these json blobs for you. Use the `--help` argument for more details.


Font JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fonts have a JSON descriptor file that looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{
    "url": "sundown-7x13.png",

    // Optional copyright and license information
    "license": "Public Domain 2018 by Danika Farheed",

    // Size of the glyph bounding boxes. Include gutter pixels in the
    // char_size. The loader repacks glyphs tightly, so extra padding
    // or horizontal alignment is irrelevant at runtime (but affects
    // distribution size and loading time).
    "char_size": {"x": 8, "y": 14},

    // Spacing between letters and lines during rendering. If the
    // x spacing is zero (for script fonts), there will be no space between
    // letters or digits, but space will still be added around symbols.
    "letter_spacing": {"x": 2, "y": 3},

    // Defaults to 1 pixel
    "shadow_size": 1,

    // Zero-based Y value of the baseline relative to char_size.
    // This is one less than the "height" of the baseline because
    // of the zero based value.
    "baseline": 11
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can generate a default version of this JSON with the
[Fontpack✜](../tools/fontpack.html) tool from a PNG image.
You can generate a PNG template for the glyphs by taking a
screenshot from the [Fontgen✜](../tools/fontgen.html) tool.

By convention, the image filename contains the maximum size of the
individual glyphs, which is usually smaller than the char_size due to
gutters. The file can have any name, however.

The image must be grayscale, where white is the font character and
black will become transparent. The current implementation does not
allow shades of gray for antialiasing. The image tiles must follow
this exact character format:

![Figure [figFont]: The font character layout](../fonts/deja-15.png)

The six dots on the final row are reserved for future characters.

Because only the specified grid of tiles is read, you can include
non-character information off the bounds of the tiles, for example,
putting a copyright statement directly on the font itself.

Fonts count towards the sprite sheet resource limits. Because a font is
32x26 glyphs, this means that the largest `char_size` can be
is 24x29 pixels if the `shadow_size` is one pixel.

Fonts enforce uniform width on all full-size digits 0..9 so that
numbers print in aligned columns. Avoid drawing fonts with one digit
that is larger than most of the others (usually the "4")
because they result in extra padding around all digits.

`font.line_height`
: When loaded into memory, the font object exposes a
  `font.line_height` property that is the spacing used between
  consecutive baselines. This is chosen to make typical letters well
  spaced. It may leave some symbols overlapping on adjacent lines,
  especially for decorative fonts. This is the height of the actual
  characters plus the `char_size.y` value.


Sound JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sound JSON descriptor looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{
    "url": "boom.mp3",

    // Optional license and copyright
    "license": "Released into the public domain by Edouard Gauthier"
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sounds must be in MP3 format.


Map JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The map JSON descriptor looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{
    "url": "overworld.tmx",

    // Optional. Shift the map by this amount in pixels for all coordinate
    // transformations and rendering. Default = 0, 0.
    "offset": {"x": 7.5, "y": 7.5},

    // z value of the first layer. Optional, default = 0
    "z_offset": 0,

    // Optional. Default = false. If true, flip the map
    // vertically during load so that (0,0) is the bottom
    // of the TMX map instead of the top.
    "y_up": false,

    // Optional. Default = false.
    "wrap_x": false,

    // Optional. Default = false.
    "wrap_y": false,

    // Optional. Default is 1.0. This is the z difference
    // between layers when rendering. Can be negative to
    // reverse layering direction.
    "z_scale": 2,

    // Optional license and copyright
    "license": "Released into the public domain by Edouard Gauthier",

    // Optional if the map only uses one spritesheet
    "sprite_url": "tiles.sprite.json"

    // If no sprite_url is specified, then an entire table
    // mapping each spritesheet referenced in the map to a sprite file
    "sprite_url_table": {
      "tiles":   "tiles.sprite.json"
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The url must reference a map file in [TMX format](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/) and
in files ending with `.tmx`. Only the following properties are currently supported:

- Orthogonal
- CSV format
- Tile layers (other layers are ignored)
- Embedded tileset (a PNG reference in the TMX, _not_ a TSX file)

Flipped sprites (horizontal, vertical, and both) in TMX maps are
supported. Rotated sprites are not supported.  Note that 180 degree
rotation can be achieved by flipping both horizontally and vertically.

![Tiled program options for creating a new map.](tiled-new-map.png width=50% style="image-rendering:auto")

The tile render order from the map is ignored.

The easiest way to create these is using the open source [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
editor, which has pay-what-you-want precompiled binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The
sprite sheet from the map file will be used for visualization if it is available in the IDE,
but map rendering is performed using a sprite sheet at runtime.

When drawing, layer zero for `draw_map()` corresponds to the lowst layer in Tiled and
the layer indices increase upwards.


PyxlScript Language
=========================================================================

Numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Numbers are stored internally as double-precision (64-bit) IEEE floating point
values. Integer operators truncate the decimal places of their arguments.

The first 2^53=9007199254740992 contiguous positive integers are
exactly representable. The largest finite representable number is
about 1.7977x10^308. There are about seventeen decimal digits of
precision on arbitrary numbers. `NaN` and positive and negative infinity
are also exactly representable.

Finite numeric literals contain an optional single plus or minus sign and one of:

- a series of digits, followed by an optional decimal point and a series of digits
- a decimal point followed by a series of digits
- one of the following single-character fractions, representing one-half to one-tenth: `½ ⅓ ⅔ ¼ ¾ ⅕ ⅖ ⅗ ⅘ ⅙ ⅐ ⅛ ⅑ ⅒`

Two optional suffixes are permitted:

- Percent `%` divides the number by 100
- Degrees `deg` or `°` multiplies the number by `π/180`

Examples of legal numeric literals:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
1
-21.4
0
-0
.0
0.5
-½
+72.41
15% // 0.15
90° // ½π
45deg // ¼π
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No hexadecimal, octal, binary, or exponential notation are
supported. Trailing decimal points are not allowed. For example, `0.`
is illegal.


Booleans
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The boolean literals are `true` and `false`.

Logical operators work with any values. For logical operators and flow
control, `0`, `∅`, and empty string `""` act as `false`.


Strings
--------------------------------------------------------------------

String literals are enclosed in double quotes (`"..."`). They may not contain newlines or
double quotes.

To enter a double quotation mark or slash, escape it with a slash: `"\\"` is the `\` character
and `"\""` is the `"` character.

The `+` operator performs string concatenation, coercing the right-hand argument if it is not a
string. String characters are read-only substrings accessed using zero-based array syntax.


Arrays
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Arrays are ordered sets of values. They are zero-based and have
dynamically typed elements.  Array literals are surrounded in square
brackets and separated by commas. Square brackets are also used for
l-value and r-value dereference. 

Array examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
a = [8, 4, 1]
a[0] = "hello"
debug_print(a[0])
debug_print(size(a))
a₁ += 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Negative indices are permitted on arrays but will not be reported in the length. Reading an
out-of-bounds value from an Array returns `∅`.


Objects
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objects are unordered sets of keys. Objects (also known as
dictionaries and tables in other languages) map these keys to values.
Literals are created using key-value pairs separated by a colon,
surrounded by curly braces, and delimited by commas. Object elements
can be accessed using the string name of a property in square brackets
or by a period. This allows them to act as objects/structs.

Object examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
t = {x:3, y:10}
t.x += 1
debug_print(t["x"])
debug_print(size(t))
debug_print(keyArray(t))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions are first-class values. They can be passed to and returned from other functions,
stored in data structures, and bound to variables. Declare functions with `def` and
return values from them with `return`. Separate the argument list from the body with `:`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Multi-line function block
def solve(a, b, c):
   return ½(sqrt(b² - 4 a * c) - b) / a

// Inline function
def foo(x): x += 1; return 2 x

// Call a user function
text(foo(3))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no way to declare an anonymous function or use a function
definition as an expression.

If a function body takes too long to execute, then the interpreter
may terminate the program to prevent the game from becoming
unresponsive.

To call a function returned from an expression that ends in
parentheses, use the `call` function.

To avoid having to indent the entire function body twice for the 
common case of preserving a transform, a joint `def-preserving_transform` statement is
available:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
def draw_stuff(a, b, c) preserving_transform:
   set_transform(...)
   ...

// is the same as:

def draw_stuff(a, b, c):
   preserving_transform:
      set_transform(...)
      ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variable name identifiers consist of an optional upper case delta plus a series of Roman
letters, or the unambiguous-looking Greek letters `αβγδζηθιλμρσϕχτψωΩ` by themselves, and
optionally trailing a series of digits. Greek letters may also be trailed by
an underscore and a series of letters and digits.
The identifier also must not be a reserved word. No
underscores or other unicode characters are allowed in identifiers.

Examples of legal identifiers:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
col
screen
long_variable
longVariable
L
i
damage
Y2
Δx
θ
θ_in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables are declared to the scope of the containing block or
mode. Scope blocks are denoted by a statement ending in a colon and zero or
more indented lines.

Use `let` to declare variable names that can later be re-bound. Use
`const` to declare constants that cannot be rebound. Note that `const`
marks the *binding* as constant, but the bound value itself may be
mutated if it is an object or array.

Note that only a single variable is permitted per `let` or `const`
statement.  Multiple statements may be chained using semi-colons on a
single line, however.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const x = 7 // x may not be rebound
let y       // Declare y
let z = 9   // Declare and initialize z

// Declare and initialize two variables on the same line:
let a = [1, 2]; let b = "hello"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The variables captured by `for` and `with` and the arguments to a
`def` are bound to the scope of the body.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const scale = 2
let y = 100

for i < 3:
   y += 1
   sprite(hero[anim][0], xy(scale * i, y))

def applyScale(x):
   return x * scale

// i is out of scope here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables declared within a mode are local to that mode and
reinitialized every frame. Variables declared in a global file are
global to the entire program.

It is an error to assign to a variable before it is declared.


### Reserved Words


These are reserved tokens that cannot be used as variable names. Some
of them are keywords, and some of them do nothing now but are reserved
for future use.

`ADD`, `and`, `arguments`, `args`, `as`, `async`, `at`, `auto`, `await`,
`because`, `begin`, `bitand`, `bitnot`, `bitor`, `bitashl`, `bitshl`, `bitshr`, `break`,
`catch`, `class`, `const`, `cont`, `coroutine`, `continue`, `constructor`,
`deg`, `do`, `delete`, `def`, `default`, `DIV`,
`elif`, `end`, `extern`, `enum`,
`final`, `finally`, `for`, `from`, `freeze`, `function`,
`get`, `global`, `go`, `goto`,
`has`,
`if`, `in`, `implements`, `inherits`, `include`, `import`, `interface`,
`launch_game`, `let`, `local`,
`NaN`, `new`, `nil`, `nonlocal`, `not`, `null`,
`main`, `MAD`, `mod`, `module`, `mode`, `MUL`,
`or`, `otherwise`,
`public`, `private`, `protected`, `prototype`, `package`, `preserve`, `preserving_transform`,
`quit_game`,
`ret`, `return`, `reset_game`, `require`, `requires`,
`seal`, `set`, `show`, `static`, `strict`, `SUB`, `swap`,
`to`, `toString`, `then`, `try`, `throw`, `template`, `touch`,
`until`, `use`, `using`, `unless`,
`var`,
`while`, `with`, `when`,
`xor`,
`yield`.


Built-in functions such as `draw_tri` that are legal identifiers can be
rebound. They are not reserved. `cos`, `sin`, and `tan` by themselves
are bound to first-class functions, but the special syntax that allows
them to be invoked without parentheses on single variables is tied to
their exact names. If you rebind them, then the new functions that you
have bound will be invoked.



### `with` Statement

The `with` statement creates a local scope in which explicitly named
keys from an object are variables aliased to the properties on the
object.

This allows compact syntax for repeated use of those keys. It fills
the role that methods and member variables do within object-oriented
languages. The local variables shadow any global (or enclosing `with`
statement) variables.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
G = {x:1, y:2, z:0}
with x,y in G:
   x = 100
   y = 0
   z = 4

// G.x is now 100, G.y is now 0, G.z is still 0,
// and global z is now 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within the body, the local variables and the properties are true
aliases. So, `G.x` and `x` may be used interchangably within the body
in the above example.

The single-line version of the `with` statement is comparable to other
single-line flow control:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
G = {x:1, y:2, z:0}
with x,y ∈ G: x = 100; y = 0; z = 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`with` statements can make code clean but are expensive relative to
the overhead of other statements, so avoid them for performance-sensitive
inner loops.


### `local` Statement


The `local` statement allows you to create a block without any other
bindings or flow control.  It is occasionally useful for creating
variables with a tight scope inside a long function or mode.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let x = 4

local:
   // This is a local scope and variables
   // can shadow those in the outer scopes
   let x = 7

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Comments
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments follow C/C++/Java/JavaScript syntax of `//` for single line comments and `/*`...`*/`
for multi-line comments.

`because "reason"`
: The special `because` statement allows a compile-time string comment to follow
  a mode or game change control flow statement such as `set_mode()`. It acts as
  a machine-readable comment that the IDE will use to automatically annotate the program
  in the debug output and the mode diagram.



Operators
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Arithmetic operators and functions are overloaded to operate on
numbers, objects, and arrays, and mixtures of objects/arrays and
numbers where that makes sense.

Some operators support a compact Unicode version and an ASCII version
that is easier to type on a conventional keyboard.

ASCII    | Unicode | Meaning
---------|---------|--
`++`     |         | increment
`--`     |         | decrement
`=`      |         | assignment
`==`     |`≟`      | equality test
`!=`     |`≠`      | inequality test
`+`      |         | addition and string concatenation
`-`      |         | negation
`+=`     |         | mutating addition, string concatenation
`-=`     |         | mutating subtraction
`<`      |         | less-than
`<=`     |`≤`      | less-than or equal to
`>`      |         | greater-than
`>=`     |`≥`      | greater-than or equal to
`in`     |`∈`      | `for` loop container element-of and `with` statement object
`^`      |         | exponentiation (see also unicode exponents)
`*`      |         | multiplication (see also implicit multiplication)
`*=`     |         | mutating multiplication
`/`      |         | floating-point division
`/=`     |         | mutating division
`mod`    |         | remainder (modulo)
         |`⌊⌋`     | floor function
         |`⌈⌉`     | ceiling function
`||`     |         | absolute value
         |`‖‖`     | magnitude (of a vector or array)
`[]`     |         | object/array element or array constructor
`{}`     |         | object constructor (follow JavaScript syntax)
`.`      |         | object property
`()`     |         | grouping or function call
`...`    | `…`     | spread operator
`bitand` |`∩`      | bitwise AND (bit set intersection)
         |`∩=`     | mutating bitwise AND
`bitor`  |`∪`      | bitwise OR (bit set union)
         |`∪=`     | mutating bitwise OR
`or`     |         | logical OR
`not`    |         | logical NOT
`and`    |         | logical AND
`bitxor` |`⊕`      | bitwise XOR
         |`⊕=`     | mutating bitwise XOR
`bitnot` |`~`      | bitwise NOT
`~=`     |         | mutating bitwise NOT
`<<`     |`◀`      | bit shift left
`<<=`    |`◀=`     | mutating bit shift left
`>>`     |`▶`      | bit shift right
`>>=`    |`▶=`     | mutating bit shift right
`if`...`then`...`else`| | conditional
`default`|         | default value

Assignment and mutating operators all return `nil`; they cannot be
chained or used in expressions.

There is no logical XOR in PyxlScript.

The `default` operator has the form: _expr1_ `default` _expr2_. If
_expr1_ is not `nil`, then the value of the operation is the value
of `_expr1_`. If it is `nil`, then _expr2_ is evaluated and the value of the expression is
the value of `_expr2_`. This allows compact statements handling default arguments
or out of bounds array accesses, for example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Returns a transparent gray. Opacity is optional
// and defaults to 1
def transparent_gray(g, opacity):
  return rgba(g, g, g, opacity default 1)
  

// Print the first element of array matching target, or 
// the first element of the entire array if not found.
debug_print(array[find(array, target) default 0])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conditional operator (distinct from the `if` block statement) has
the form: `if testexpr then truevalue else falsevalue`.  Note that
there are no colons (:), because it does not create blocks. The
conditional operator is convenient when initializing constants, or
data structures. For example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const y = if x > 3 then "cat" else "dog"

spawnMonster(if pos then pos else xy(0,0))

let data = {name: if i > 2 then "Peter" else "Amit",
            height: 7}

setTarget(if ‖pos - P.pos‖ > 10 then ∅ else P)

// Because "and" and "or" operate on non-booleans, the examples
// above could have been written less clearly with alternative
// logic:

const y = (x > 3) and "cat" or "dog"

spawnMonster(pos or xy(0,0))

let data = {name: (i > 2) and "Peter" or "Amit",
            height: 7}

// Note that this one had to be restructured
// because ∅ acts as false for "and"
setTarget(‖pos - P.pos‖ ≤ 10 and P or ∅)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To nest conditionals, you must put parentheses around at least the
`falsevalue`, for example `y = if x > 3 then "cat" else (if x > 2 then
"dog" else "llama")`.

`a default b` is equal to `a` if `a` is not `nil` and `b`
otherwise. It does not evaluate `b` if `a` was not `nil`.  This is
equivalent to the JavaScript and C#
[nullish](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator)
`??` operator. Some common uses are:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript

// Default value on load
num_players = load_local("num_players") default 2

// Default value on missing object property
height = character_height[name] default 170

// Default value on going out of array bounds
vel = array[i + 2] default xy(2, 3)

// Fallback value on find() failing
debug_print(array[find(array, target) default 0])

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Spaces are not required around operators in most cases, so long as the text parses
unambiguously. For example, `1or3` is equivalent to `1 or 3`. There is no ASCII operator for
floor or ceiling; use the `floor` and `ceil` functions. There is no way to express mutating bitwise
operators using ASCII.

Behavior of these operators is consistent with the JavaScript definition of the operation
(even though JavaScript uses different operators). For example, the <b>logical</b>-AND expression
`4 and 1` evaluates to `1` because `4` is non-false and the result of non-false AND another
value is the other value.

The trigonometric functions `cos`, `sin`, and `tan` may be invoked as if they were operators
when the order of operations is unambiguous. For example, `cos a` ==> `cos(a)`, `cosβ` ==>
`cos(β)`, and `cosθ*sinφ` ==> `cos(θ) * sin(φ)`.  To avoid confusion and reserve future syntax,
they may not be invoked in this form when a high-precedence operator follows the argument. Those
operators are `.`, `[`, and exponentiation.

Because back-to-back parentheses are interpreted as implicit multiplication, functions that
are returned from other functions, determined by parenthesized expressions, or stored in
objects cannot be invoked using the `()` syntax. Instead, use the `call` function:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Illegal:
x = (a and abs or cos)(θ)
y = tbl["myfunc"](3, 4)
z = f(a)(b)

// Legal:
x = call(a and abs or cos, θ)
y = call(tbl["myfunc"], 3, 4)
z = call(f(a), b)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


### Exponents

The characters `⁺⁻⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹ᵃᵝⁱʲᵏⁿᵘˣʸᶻ⁽⁾` can form exponent expressions that operate as if
the `^` operator or `pow` function was invoked using those expressions as a second argument.
The entire exponent expression is implicitly surrounded in parentheses.

The variables `a`, `β`, `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `u` may appear only as single-character
variable names in exponents.

Exponentiation, including via exponent characters, may not be performed on a negative number
without parentheses. This follows the rules from JavaScript's `**` operator. For example,
`x=y-1²` is legal, but `x=y+-1²` is illegal and must be rewritten as `x=y+(-1)²` or (the
confusing and redundant expression, if that's really what was intended) `x=y+-(1²)`.


### Implicit Multiplication

Multiplication is implicit wherever a number is immediately followed by a parenthesized
expression or variable (including a function call). This also ocurrs when any exponent
appears immediately preceeding a parenthesized expression or variable, and where two
parenthesized expressions are back to back. For example,
`2x`, `x²y`, `3(x+y)`, `(y+2)(x+1)`.

Implicit multiplication can be used within exponents.


### Spread Operator

The spread operator (`…` or `...`) allows defining and calling
functions with a variable number of arguments. It is the same as
`*rest` in Python and `...rest` in JavaScript.

In a function declaration it designates the final argument as an array of all further arguments.
For example, `def foo(a, b, …rest):` takes any number of arguments and maps them to `a`, `b`,
and then an array `rest` of the remainder.
For example, `def bar(…args):` takes any number of arguments and maps them all into
array `args`.

In a function call or array literal, the spread operator expands an array as if its elements had
been entered inline. So, `bar(…a)` calls a function with all of the arguments from array `a`.
`[1, 2, …a, 10]` creates an array that begins with 1 and 2, then has all of the elements of `a`,
followed by the number 10.



### Built-in Objects

The following are built-in constants and special zero-argument operators. They are
not variable names and thus cannot be redefined. Several have both unicode and ASCII names.

Symbol         | ASCII           | Value
---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------
`ε`            | `epsilon`       | `0.000001`
`π`            | `pi`            | `3.141592653589793115997963468544185161590576171875`
`∞`            | `infinity`      | infinity
               | `nan`           | floating-point "not-a-number" value
               | `CREDITS`       | object of credit and license statements from assets and code
`∅`            | `nil`           | ("undefined")
               | `pad`           | array gamepad of objects
               | `joy`           | shorthand for `pad₀`
`ξ`            | `random()`      | random number on [0, 1), resampled every time the expression is used
               | `SCREEN_SIZE`   | the size of the screen in pixels, defaults to `xy(384, 224)`
               | `CONSTANTS`     | an object mapping all game-specific constants to their values
               | `ASSETS`        | an object mapping all game-specific assets to their values


Loops and Flow Control
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The flow control statements are:

- Blocks:
  - `if` conditional with optional `else` and `else if` clauses
  - `while` loop
  - `until` loop
  - `for` loop and `for...in` loop, both with optional `with` expansion.
     _See also the `iterate()` function_.
  - `break` and `continue` within loops
  - `preserving_transform` and `local`, which do not have branching flow
    but do create local scopes
  - `def`, which creates a local scope for a function but does not execute
    immediately
- Modes:
  - `set_mode(ModeName)` to switch game modes. The note is optional.
  - `push_mode(ModeName)` and `pop_mode()` to temporarily
   enter a mode game mode. The notes are optional.
- Game:
  - `reset_game()` to reset all state and restart the game.
  - `quit_game()` to end the current game and return to the launcher.
  - `launch_game(url)` to launch a different game.

`set_mode()`, `push_mode()`, `pop_mode()`, `reset_game()`, `quit_game()`, and `launch_game()` may be
followed by the keyword `because` and a reason that is a compile-time string. For example, `quit_game() because "lives = 0"`.
The reason allows the IDE to label the transitions on the mode diagram for the game.

There is no switch, do loop, goto, or try/catch.

Whitespace is significant, as in Python. Indentation must be exactly a
single space per nested block.

For flow control purposes, the empty string, 0, and `∅` are false.  All other objects (including empty data structures) are true.

Within any loop, `continue` skips to the next iteration of the loop and `break` exits the loop.

Multi-line `if` statements may be followed by `else:` and `else if ...:` clauses. These must always be
multi-line.

Numeric `for` loops increment by 1 each iteration and always count up. The loop variable must
be on the left-side of a single comparison loop expression or the center of a multi-comparison
expression.

The loop variable in any `for` loop is freshly bound for each iteration. This means that
if it is captured by a function as in:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let array = []
for i < 3
   def capture(): return i
   push(array, capture)

for f in array: debug_print(f())
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

that the value will reflect the time of the capture. This avoids many common bugs when using
first class functions with loops.

Container iteration `for` loops iterate over the keys of a object, the
characters of a string, or the elements of an array. 

`while` loops evaluate the condition at the top of the loop for every
iteration.

`for` loops evaluate the bounds once, before the first iteration.

`for...in` loops evaluate the container expression once, before the
first iteration.

It is illegal (and will usually result in an error) to add or remove
values from the container of a `for...in` loop. This semantic avoids
confusing situations for the programmer and is necessary for
performance optimizations in the iterator implementation. Changing
the order of values is legal, but discouraged because the iterator
will touch each slot in order and will skip or duplicate values if they
change slots. Writing to the current value is legal and frequently useful.

If you would like to add or remove from the container, transform your code from
`for x in container:` to `for x in clone(container):`. Cloning is
fairly fast in PyxlScript. Or, use the syntax
`let i = 0; while i < size(container): let x = container[i] ... ++i` and account for the
index and size changes in your own iteration.

The main variations of a `for...in` loop are:

- `for key in object:`
- `for value at key in object:`
- `for value in array:`
- `for value at index in array:`
- `for value at index in string:`

The value variable is bound with `let`, so assignment to the value
variable is legal but will not affect the underlying value in the array.

In any loop, `break` immediately terminates the tightest enclosing loop
and `continue` immediately begins the next iteration of the tightest
enclosing loop.

The Java/C++ equivalents of `for`-loop conditions are:

quadplay✜             | Java/C++
----------------------|------------------------
`for i ≤ k`           | `for (i = 0; i <= k; ++i)`
`for i &lt; k`        | `for (i = 0; i &lt; k; ++i)`
`for 4 ≤ i &lt; k`    | `for (i = 4; i &lt; k; ++i)`
`for 4 &lt; i &lt; k` | `for (i = 5; i &lt; k; ++i)`
`for x ∈ S`           | `for (x : S)`

You can pack a `for` and `with` statement together by chaining `∈`
expressions, in what is called a `for`-`with` loop. The properties
exposed by the `with` are references to the actual values and can be
mutated directly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
for x,y ∈ point ∈ set:
   ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

is the same as:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
for point ∈ set:
   with x,y ∈ point:
      ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `for`-loop variable (in this case, `point`) cannot be the same as any of the `with`
variables (in this case, `x` and `y`).

The comparison operators in a `for` loop declaration are an overloaded syntax for comparison
operators (just as many languages overload the `=` operator for `for` loops).  They have
the lowest precedence. For example, `for i&lt;a||b` is equivalent to `for i&lt;(a||b)`.
To use regular comparison operators within `for` loop preamble, you *must* use parentheses to
make the parsing unambiguous, for example, `for i &lt; (a &lt; b)`.

Single-line `for`, `if`, `while`, and `until` are permitted. There can be multiple
single-line expressions on the same line. No `else` is permitted with single-line `if`.

The variable list in a `for`-`with` or `with` expression can be split across multiple
lines by breaking after commas:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
for health, power,
    stamina in character:
   health += stamina * power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The `until` loop is a `while` loop with an inverted test:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
until x == "end":
  x = find_next(x, data)


// Is the same as:
while x != "end":
  x = find_next(x, data)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Examples

#### `for` loop variations

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Iterate over each current enemy once, destroying those
// that overlap the missile
for enemy in clone(enemy_array):
    if overlaps(enemy, missile):
        remove_value(enemy_array, enemy)
        

// Regenerate hit points for every player
for health, regen_rate in player in player_array:
    health += regen_rate


// Position each equally-spaced satellite
for satellite at i in satellite_array:
    const a = i * 360deg / size(planet_array)
    satellite.pos = xy(cos a, sin a) * ORBIT_RADIUS


// Iterate over an object's keys
for rating at stat in player.stats:
    draw_text(font, stat + ": " + format_number(rating, "%"), pos, #FFF)
    pos.y += font.line_height


// Iterate over an object used as a set
already_visited[current_room] = true

for room_name in already_visited:
    draw_text(font, room_name, pos, #FFF)
    pos.y += font.line_height
    

// Make a segmented-body centipede move
if joy.x or joy.y:
    // Don't use += because the loop passes objects instead of copying them
    centipede[0] = centipede[0] + joy.xy
    for 0 < i < size(centipede):
        centipede[i] = centipede[i - 1]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[`for` loop examples]


#### Array Iteration

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let names = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]

// Iterate over array elements
let pos = xy(½ SCREEN_SIZE.x, 10)
for planet in names:
   pos.y += draw_text(font, planet, pos, #f)

// Iterate over values and modify (this is safe, no elements will be
// skipped. You can even remove elements ahead of the iterator and
// they will still be processed)
for planet in names:
   // Remove any name with an "a" in it
   if find(planet, "a") ≠ ∅: remove_values(names, planet)

   // Add some random moons...the current loop will not
   // iterate over these, but they are immediately visible
   // in the array.
   if random() > 50%: push(names, planet + " moon")

// Iterate over array keys
pos = xy(½ SCREEN_SIZE.x, 10)
for i < size(names):
   pos.y += draw_text(font, names[i], pos, #f)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#### Object Iteration

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let poemBy = {
   Angelou: "Still I Rise",
   Frost: "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening",
   Dickenson: "Because I could not stop for Death",
   Whitman: "Leaves of Grass",
   Hughes: "Montage of a Dream Deferred",
   Williams: "In the American Grain",
   Yeats: "Sailing to Byzantium",
   Browning: "How Do I Love Thee?"
}

// Iterate over array elements
let pos = xy(½ SCREEN_SIZE.x, 10)
for author in poemBy:
   pos.y += draw_text(font, poemBy[author] + " by " + author, pos, #f)

// Iterate over values and modify (this is safe, no elements will be skipped)
for author in poemBy:
   // Remove this entry if it contains an "a" in the value
   if find(poemBy[authpr], "a") ≠ ∅: remove_key(poemBy, author)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#### Array of Objects

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let spots = [xy(1, 1), xy(100, 2), xy(10, 20), xy(50, 20)]

for x, y in S in spots:
   // Remove any element that is higher than 15
   if y > 15: remove_values(spots, S)

let i = 0
while i < size(spots):
   // More efficient O(1) removal without preserving order
   // if spots is *really* long
   if spots[i].x > 15: fast_remove_key(spots, i)
   else: ++i
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Debugging
---------------------------------------------------------

There are two special forms for debugging that can be enabled or
disabled at runtime for efficiency on the Output pane. These are not
functions and cannot be passed as values like functions or stored in
data structures.

`debug_print(msg)` sends text output to the IDE Output pane. It runs
`unparse()` on `msg` if it is not already a string. These statements
are automatically removed from the program when debug printing is
disabled.

`assert(condition)` or `assert(condition, msg)` halts program
execution if `condition` is false. The `msg` is evaluated regardless
of the value of condition. These statements are automatically removed
from the program when assertions are disabled.



Multiline Expressions
---------------------------------------------------------------

Newlines end PyxlScript expressions, unless there are unbalanced
brackets (), [], {}. This allows you to spread function calls, array
literals, and object literals over multiple lines.  For example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let player = {
   center: xy(100, 40),
   angle: 45deg,
   inventory: ["hat", "sword",
      "money", "watch", "apple"]
}

let x = (43 +
   17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an error occurs in a multiline expression, the line number reported
will be that of the beginning of the expression. If a line contains
the end of a multiline expression, it may not also contain multiple statements.



Symbols
---------------------------------------------------------------

The quadplay✜ IDE supports autocorrect for typing the optional special
symbols such as `nil` --> `∅`, `1/2` --> `½`, and `>=` --> `≥`. To generate
paired symbols, type the name of the corresponding function without arguments.
For example: `floor()` --> `⌊⌋`, `ceil()` --> `⌈⌉`, `magnitude()` --> `‖‖`,
and `abs()` --> `||`.

For convenience when using an external editor or typing the full set
of characters supported by fonts into strings on a US-EN keyboard, you
can also copy and paste from here:


````````````````````````````````````````````````````` none big

[Subscript symbols]

Note that the superscripts `ᵈᵉʰᵐᵒʳˢᵗ` are legal in text strings but
not as code. These are present specfically to support ordinals such as
"1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ, 4ᵗʰ, 1ᵉʳ, 1ʳᵉ, 2ᵉ, 2ᵈ, 2ᵈᵉ, 1ᵒ, 1ᵃ, …" in
various languages.

The encircled characters and arrows are intended for use as button
prompts.  The characters `Ⓞ ⍍ ▣ ⧉ ☰` are drawn in quadplay✜ fonts to
represent the buttons with approximately those symbols on PlayStation
and Xbox controllers. The `ⓧ` character is drawn to ambiguously
represent the "X"/cross buttons on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo
controllers. Note that the preferred way of generating button prompts
is using the `gamepad.prompt` object with the string `replace()`
function, rather than hardcoding.


Advanced Tools
====================================================================================

In addition to the friendlier browser-based tools from the Tools
section, the distribution includes command-line tools for experienced
programmers. These support external editors, running the server
locally, and performing some IDE tasks at the command line. Unlike the
IDE, some of these have additional dependencies and assume that you
know how to install those on your own.


Local Emulator
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can launch the IDE on your local machine. This allows you to run
without a network connection and to work with local files instead of
Google Drive ones for the GitHub-hosted IDE.

Launch your program in the emulator and debugger from the command line
on Windows, macOS, or Linux with the `quadplay` command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
# Load the games/quadpaddle/quadpaddle.game.json sample program
quadplay quad://games/quadpaddle

# Load a mygames/space/space.game.json game that you've made
quadplay mygames/space

# Load from the internet (server must support CORS)
quadplay https://morgan3d.github.io/somegame/foo.game.json

# Just run the emulator. You can modify the URL in your browser
# to add "?game=" and the game's URL or relative path
quadplay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run `quadplay --help` to see more options for the script.

These examples assume that your directory structure is:

**********************************************************
*
*   📂 quadplay
*   |
*   +-- 📄 quadplay
*   |
*   +-- 📂 fonts
*   |   |
*   |   ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 games
*   |   |
*   |   +-- 📂 quadpaddle
*   |   |   |
*   |   |   +-- 📄 quadpaddle.game.json
*   |   |   |
*   |   ⋮   ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 mygames
*   |   |
*   |   '-- 📂 space
*   |       |
*   |       +- 📄 space.game.json
*   |       |
*   |       ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 sprites
*   |   |
*   ⋮   ⋮
**********************************************************
[Directory structure with the `quadplay` script in the root.]

The directory and `.game.json` file do not have to have the same
name. You can list the full path to the actual game file instead.

Every time you push the play button (F5) or reload button (Ctrl+R) in
the emulator, it will reload your code and assets from disk.

By default, `quad://` assets are cached for fast reload peformance. To
disable this behavior, force a reload of the entire page with
shift+browser reload button, or remove `&fastReload=1` from the URL.


Visual Studio Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visual Studio Code natively supports the `.json` files. To configure it with
PyxlScript file support as well:

1. Run Visual Studio Code
2. Press F1 and type `install code` and then press enter
3. Open a terminal and change directory to `quadplay/tools`
4. At the command line, run `code --install-extension vscode-pyxlscript.vsix`


Vim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the PyxlScript mode for Vim, you'll need to modify your .vimrc.

If you're using a plugin manager like [dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
call dein#add("path/to/quadplay/tools/vim-pyxlscript-syntax", {'frozen':1})
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to directly copy the files into your ~/.vim directory, make sure you copy (or symlink) all the files into the corresponding directories like they structured in the plugin.

[`pyxlscript.vim`](../tools/pyxlscript.vim)


Emacs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the PyxlScript mode for Emacs, add the following lines to
your `~/.emacs` file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Lisp
; Optional if you don't want to copy the files:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "path/to/quadplay/tools"))
(autoload 'rainbow-mode "rainbow-mode")
(autoload 'pyxlscript-mode "pyxlscript-mode")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.pyxl\\'" . pyxlscript-mode))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that you have to put the real path in for the `"path/to/quadplay/tools"`,
such as `~/quadplay/tools`, or wherever you installed quadplay to.


Other Editors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fortunately, PyxlScript syntax is very close to Python syntax. If you
tell your editor to treat `.pyxl` files as Python files, then it will
probably handle indenting and most keywords correctly. Comments are
the one element that will probably confuse your syntax highlighter.


Command-Line Tools
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[`quadplay`](../quadplay)
: Launches the emulator from the command line on any operating system.
  Requires Python. See the arguments above.

[`quaddepend.py`](../tools/quaddepend.py)
: Prints dependencies of a `.game.json` file, recursively. Run the script  with `--help` to
  see the arguments. Run as `tools/quaddepend.py ...` or `python3 tools/quaddepend.py ...`
  from the main quadplay directory.

[`export.py`](../tools/quaddepend.py)
: Export a static HTML site for a single game, either lightweight by referencing
  `https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay` or standalone by embedding a full copy of
  the emulator. Run the script with `--help` to see the arguments.

  Run as `tools/export.py ...` or `python3 tools/export.py ...`
  from the main quadplay directory. This script itself depends on `tools/quaddepend.py`.

[`sprite_json_generator.py`](../tools/sprite_json_generator.py)
: Generator for `.sprite.json` files. Requires Python and PIL.

  If you are exporting from aseprite, use the following settings with `sprite_json_generator.py`:

  - "horizontal strip" (quadplay doesn't support animations wrapping around image rows
  - "padding", "trim", and "extrude" should all be off
  - "Layers" should be visible layers (quadplay doesn't support layers")
  - "frames" should be "all frames" (unless you only want some frames)
  - "export json": yes and under "meta" for this:
    - "layers" should be off
    - "frame tags" should be checked
    - "slices" should be off
  - "open generated sprite sheet" is up to you, if you want it to show you the sprite sheet when its done.

  If you export with these settings, you can pass the generated json file to the  sprite_json_generator program and it will convert the tags and sprite size
  automatically from the file.

  Note that while aseprite supports sprites of varying size, quadplay does not.


`quadplay.html`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `quadplay.html` application launched by the `quadplay` script accepts the following
HTML query arguments:

`IDE`
: If set, load in development mode with access to the full IDE and stop and pause
  buttons. Cannot be set with `kiosk`

`fastReload`
: If `1`, do not force reloading of `quad://` files from disk but instead allow
  browser caching. Those resources are unlikely to change (unless you are modifying
  quadplay itself!), so this speeds up game reloading, especially for music.

`game`
: URL of a game to load, which can be relative to the `quadplay` script.

`mode`
: Initial mode to display: `Maximal`, `Emulator`, `IDE`, or `Test`

`kiosk`
: If `1`, hide the entire menu bar. Cannot be set with `IDE`


Physical Consoles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Build

I expect most people to use quadplay✜ on phones, laptops, and desktops
as a virtual console. But, if you have some maker experience you can make a
_real_ quadplay✜ console.

#### Nano or Pi 4
With a 3D-printed case and some Bluetooth or wired game controllers,
you can build your own quadplay✜ retro mini console to connect to a TV
or monitor. [Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
and [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) cost less than $100 and can
power such a box using Linux and Chromium. Both will hit 60 Hz for most games, and can easily run at
30 Hz for all games (quadplay✜ handles framerate scaling for you seamlessly,
so you won't even notice most of the time). Jetson Nano is more expensive but has the advantage of a 
more powerful processor. Raspberry Pi 3B+ can run some quadplay games, but will underperform
on those with sophisticated graphics.


![Quadplay mini-console built by Morgan McGuire from a Jetson Nano with a 3D-printed case, USB Xbox 360 controller, and small external monitor.](nano-arcade.jpg width=50%)

I've built Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi consoles and the result is satisfyingly comparable to
the Nintendo [NES Classic Edition](https://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/),
[Super NES Classic Edition](https://www.nintendo.com/super-nes-classic/), 
Sega [Genesis Mini](https://genesismini.sega.com/), and
PlayStation [Classic](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/explore/playstation-classic/) devices. The big difference
from commercial mini retro consoles is that you can program your own quadplay console. The commercial consoles
only play their own games.

![Self-contained quadplay console built by Morgan McGuire from a Raspberry Pi and standard screen case, with Bluetooth controllers.](rpi-arcade.jpg  style="image-rendering:none" width=50%)


#### NUC
An Intel NUC is a much more expensive device for powering a mini console,
but has a lot more graphics power than an embedded processor and will
comfortably run all games at 60 Hz.

#### Cabinets
You can also build a quadplay✜ arcade cabinet. This can be done with
some carpentry and any low-cost PC and display, or by purchasing some (expensive!)
pre-built arcade cabinets.

There are a lot of
physical
[arcade controllers](https://shop.xgaming.com/products/x-arcade-dual-joystick-usb-included)
available at reasonable prices for building out the controls without
needing any custom electronics. Note that quadplay✜ supports (but does not require) a touch screen 
or mouse, which will not be available on a normal cabinet setup. One alternative is to
use a small trackpad mounted on top of the joystick controller. 

![Arcade station built by Morgan McGuire running quadplay on a 2012 MacBook with an X-Arcade Dual controller.](xarcade-arcade.jpg style="image-rendering:none" width=50%)


![Arcade station custom built by Nick Porcino running quadplay on Raspberry Pi](arcade.jpg  style="image-rendering:none" width=50%)

When building your own controller, ensure that it maps correctly using the online tool at 
https://html5gamepad.com/. The specific mapping between HTML buttons and quadplay✜ is:

quadplay✜            |   HTML Gamepad
:-------------------:|:-------------------------------:
Analog x-axis        | axis 0 (left is negative)
Analog y-axis        | axis 1 (forward is negative)
ⓐ                    | button 0
ⓑ                    | button 1
ⓒ                    | button 2
ⓓ                    | button 3
ⓔ                    | button 4
ⓕ                    | button 5
ⓠ                    | button 8
ⓟ                    | button 9
D-pad <big>⍐</big>   | button 12
D-pad <big>⍗</big>   | button 13
D-pad <big>⍇</big>   | button 14
D-pad <big>⍈</big>   | button 15

The D-pad is not typically provided for an arcade setup. quadplay✜
automatically maps the analog stick into D-pad inputs as well
as providing analog access under `device_control()`.

The ⓔ button should be placed where it can
be easily held while using the main buttons and stick, for example, 
as a hat button on the stick or under the right thumb or pinkie. The
ⓕ button should be placed where it can be used similarly, but ⓔ should
be the more convenient of the two. Note the positioning of the
player 1 and 2 ⓔ and ⓕ on the keyboard compared to on a NES-style gamepad...the
keyboard controls place these buttons _lower_ than on a gamepad, so that they
are in reach of the pinkies for eas of holding down. They are not "shoulder"
buttons, even though that is the best location for them on a physical controller.


If building a physical cabinet or handheld _without_
on-screen mobile controls, I recommend using a 1280x720,
1600x900, or 1920x1200 display to efficiently fill the screen with
integer pixel scaling.

Some exact ratios when using quadplay's maximum 384x224 resolution are:

Screen     | Integer     | Used      | Efficiency  | Autoscaler | Used      | Efficiency
----------:|------------:|----------:|------------:|-----------:|----------:|---------:
480x320    |  1x         | 384x224   | 56%         | 1.00x      | 384x224   | 56%

### Buy

quadplay✜ works on all Mac, Windows, and Linux devices, so any computer you buy can be 
a dedicated device for playing or making games. For a _handheld_ form factor there
are a few options.

We've tested on the GPD Win 2 and it runs quadplay✜ well. Its successor is not yet available
but should also work well, in a slightly larger form factor:

 - 1280x720 [GPD Win 2](http://gpd.hk/gdpwin2), Windows and Linux = full-res quadplay✜ 3x scaling
 - 1280x800 [GPD Win Max](http://gpd.hk/gpdwinmax), Windows and Linux = full-res quadplay✜ 3x scaling

Some other physical handhelds that may be capable of running quadplay✜
games when/if released include:

 - 480x320 [Odroid-Go Advance Black](https://liliputing.com/2020/05/the-new-odroid-go-advance-adds-wifi-and-more-buttons-linux-handheld-game-console.html), Linux = full-res quadplay✜ 1x scaling; poor fit
 - 1280x720 [DragonBox Pyra](https://pyra-handheld.com/boards/pages/pyra/), Linux = full-res quadplay✜ 3x scaling
 - 1920x1080 The Smach Z
 - 1920x1200 Alienware UFO


Network
====================================================================================

You can use quadplay over a local network or the internet in several ways:

[Online Hosted](#network/onlinehosted)
: Play single-player or local multiplayer quadplay games from the internet on
   any device with a modern web browser
   
[Steam Streaming](#network/steamstreaming)
: Play quadplay games on a SteamLink or any Steam client, streaming across your local network
   from a laptop or desktop

[Network Multiplayer](#network/networkmultiplayer)
: Play multiplayer quadplay games with friends across a local network or the internet. Maybe.

[Mobile Development](#network/mobiledevelopment)
: Develop and test your quadplay game on a phone or tablet


Online Hosted
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quadplay games can be played on any device with a full modern web
browser. This includes laptops, desktops, mobile devices, embedded
processors, and some game consoles. Just enter the URL of the game's
hosting page into your browser, such as:

https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html

or launch the `quadplay` script with the URL of the game.

See the Deploying Games section to learn how to upload your own games
onto an internet server.


Steam Streaming
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Games for quadplay are usually best played through a browser. However, if you have a device 
that runs the [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about/) app or the
Steam client, but does not have a full web browser, then you can use Steam's streaming
technology to play on that device.

Steps that you only need to do once, on the hosting computer:

1. Create a free [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/join) account if you 
   do not already have one.
 
2. Install the free [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
   client on the computer that you will stream from, if it does not
   already have Steam.  The Steam client is available for macOS and
   Windows. There is a partly supported client for Linux as well.

3. Run the Steam client. From the Games menu, select "Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library...":
   ![](add-non-steam.png)

4. Select your web browser from the list. All browsers should appear under 
   Windows. If it is not listed or you are on macOS,
   select "Browse..." and then identify the application. On macOS, you can
   find `/Applications/Google Chrome.app`, `/Applications/Safari.app`,
   or `/Applications/Firefox.app` in the list that appears.
  
  
To Stream a game across a local network:

1. *On the hosting computer*, launch `quadplay --kiosk` with the name of your game.
   Press the icon in the center of the browser, so that it starts playing and
   goes fullscreen. 
   
2. *On the remote computer* where you want to play, launch Steam and 
   search your Steam library for your browser. Press the green "STREAM"
   button. After a moment, the game should start in fullscreen mode, showing
   the same view as the browser. Game controllers will work normally
   on the remote computer.

Network Multiplayer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Coming soon..._

(I'm investigating building and distributing a standalone binary quadplay on Steam.
 You could then use Steam Remote Play Together to allow up to three players to join
 you across the internet.)


Mobile Development
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The quadplay IDE allows you to easily test your game on a mobile device while 
developing from a laptop or desktop computer. 

First, launch the `quadplay` script on your computer with the `--host` flag. For example, 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
quadplay --host games/quadpaddle/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Use your own game, not the `quadpaddle` sample, of course).

Second, in the web browser that opens on your computer, select the Project or Test
view at the upper right. Click on the Host tab of the debugging pane on the lower
right:

![The QR code in the Host tab of the IDE](host-tab.png)

Third, _on your mobile device_, either scan the QR code and then open the URL
it shows in a browser, or manually type the URL into your mobile browser.

Your mobile device will now play the game direct from your computer. You can edit
the game or assets on your computer and reload the browser page on your mobile
device to see the changes. You do not need to re-scan the QR code for each change.

!!! note Mobile Controls
    On a mobile device, quadplay games be played with
    the on-screen touch controls or a physical game controller paired over
    BlueTooth or plugged in directly over USB.


Deploying Games
====================================================================================

Your games can be played on any major web browser on desktop/laptop,
phone, tablet, or embedded processor such as Jetson Nano or Raspberry
Pi. You can also distribute them as phone or desktop apps. You may
charge money for your games and may distribute them as closed
source.

It is your responsibility to satisfy copyright law and any licensing
fees or royalties for content that you use when you distribute your
game. The content provided with quadplay✜ is all royalty-free Creative Commons
and contains its own licensing data. Content that you find elsewhere
will have its own rules and restrictions. The code provided with
quadplay✜ is all Open Source (even though it permits you to use it with your
own closed-source came). See the Credits section for more information.


GitHub
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### From your development repo

This is the easiest method to deploy your game. It also allows you to
continuously update the game as well as gain the benefit of
improvements to quadplay✜ itself continuously.

Store your game in a git repository on [github.com](https://github.com), or in
a subdirectory of a GitHub repository.  Do not fork quadplay into the repo
because that will make it large and disrupt the user's saved per-console state.
Just keep your game there in the repo by itself as you create it.

Assume that your GitHub account is named `USER` and your repo is named `REPO`.

To deploy, go to the settings page for your repo on GitHub. For example,
https://github.com/USER/REPO/settings. In the section titled "GitHub Pages"
on the settings page, select "Master Branch" from the Source dropdown.

The URL to play your game is then:

`https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html?game=https://USER.github.io/REPO&mode=Maximal&kiosk=1`.

If you'd like to make a friendlier URL, then you can also create an `index.html` file
in the root of your repo with the contents:

<script>
document.write(`<pre class="listing tilde"><code>&amp;lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html?game=https://USER.github.io/REPO'"/&gt;</code></pre>`);
</script>

People visiting the URL https://USER.github.io/REPO will then be redirected to the correct page.


### From another repo

To keep your development repository private or just separate from the deployment one,
create a second repository on GitHub.

Clone both to your local machine and at the command line, enter the _development_ repo
and run 

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
python3 tools/export.py -o ../PUBLIC_REPO path/to/game
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can then add and commit the public repo. If you want your game to be standalone
and not depend on the quadplay repo at runtime, just add the `--standalone` argument.
This will generate an `index.html` file as well as copying all dependencies.



itch.io Browser
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deploying to [itch.io](https://itch.io/) as a Browser Game allows you to create a self
contained online game that others can buy from you, or play for free if you choose.
It is slightly more complicated to update than on GitHub because you must make a release
file and upload it explicitly.

The steps are:

1. Run `python3 path-to-quadplay/tools/export.py` inside the directory containing
   your `game.json` file, or `python3 tools/export.py -g path-to-your-game`.
2. Log into the itch.io website and create a new game entry with the following settings:
  - Classification: Games
  - Kind of project: HTML
  - Mobile friendly: Yes
  - Automatically start on page load: Yes
  - How should your project be run in your page?: Click to launch fullscreen
  - Orientation: Landscape
  - Visibility: Public
3. In the Uploads section on the itch.io game page, upload the zipfile generated in step 1.

To update your game or upgrade the underlying quadplay✜ distribution,
you must repeat the process of creating the zipfile and then upload it
as a replacement for the original file.


Web Server
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can host your game using only your own files on any web server that supports
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), or as a copy
of all of quadplay✜ on _any_ web server, regardless of whether it supports CORS.

To deploy your game on a web server with CORS named `myserver.com` in the `mygame`
directory, run just upload your own game files to the server. The URL for your game is:

https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html?game=https://myserver.com/mygame

To deploy a complete package that is independent of the current
version of quadplay✜, run `python3 tools/export.py -o path/to/output -g path/to/game`
and then upload your files from the output directory. 

Your URL will be just https://myserver.com/mygame.


Phones
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any quadplay✜ game hosted on a web page using the methods from the previous sections
can be played on a mobile phone. The emulator automatically creates on-screen buttons
when it detects a phone, and it also supports gamepads connected to a phone.

You can also deploy your game through a phone app store in order to sell it. This is
an advanced process. You must wrap your game with a binary program.
[Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) is a free tool that you can use to automate
this process. It requires familiarity with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), web apps,
the app store that you are deploying on, and the tools needed (such as Xcode for iOS)
to compile on the platform.

The basic idea is to use the method described in the itch.io section to create a
standalone web app, and then use Cordova to create the phone app.


Desktop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is a tool that turns web apps into desktop binary
projects which can be distributed through the Windows or Mac App stores, Steam, the
Epic Store, etc. It works by bundling an entire web browser with your application, wrapped
so that it looks like a native app. The process is similar to that of using Cordova.



Performance
====================================================================================

quadplay✜ is designed to make it easy to write small games that have
very readable source code. I recommend designing your code primarily
for readability instead of performance. However, at some point you'll
probably hit the performance limits and want to optimize at least some
of the program. Here's where to focus your efforts.

Chrome, Edge, and Safari give far better performance on graphics
calls than Firefox. Just switching browsers will give you a boost if
you're on Firefox.

To avoid input lag, process game pad input _before_ rendering and
simulation each frame. This allows the players' input to affect the
current frame instead of being delayed one frame. Game pads (and browsers)
have 1-2 frames of input lag in them. To conceal this, allow critical input
such as a jump, block, or dodge to happen up to one or two frames _after_
the period in which it should have. For example, do not damage the player
character until one frame after they are attacked and allow a late dodge
or block to save them retroactively.


In the "Performance" tab of the IDE, you can see the amount of time
spent per frame. If time spent is less than 16 ms, then your program
is running at 60 fps. If time spent is higher than 16 ms, then you may
need to optimize.

`draw_map()` is substantially faster than making the same
`draw_sprite()` calls by yourself. It culls all off-screen
sprites. Drawing a map with `camera.zoom = 1` or `z_scale = 0` is faster than
with perspective and zoom. Tiles without alpha will cull everything
behind them when not using perspective, so you don't have to leave out
the hidden map tiles for performance when drawing maps. Maps with
opaque tiles that are not rotated or scaled draw extremely fast.

A sequence of `draw_point()` commands that all have the same `z` value is
much faster than ones with mixed `z` values or broken up by other rendering
calls.

Built-in math functions are faster than math functions that you write
to do equivalent operations because they are designed to minimize
memory allocation internally. The intrinsics are maximum speed
but can make code hard to read.

There is generally no need to cull objects that are off screen. The
rendering code is very good at removing those for you.

`draw_sprite()` is fastest for `opacity=1` sprites that are not rotated
or scaled and do not have alpha. It can directly copy the memory in
this case.

If you have fully opaque map tiles in one layer, remove the tiles behind
them in other layers. It can be substantially faster (but use more memory)
to use pre-drawn transitions between map terrain tiles instead of layering
an alpha-masked tile on top of another one to blend them.

If you can tell that an object is covered by another object in `z`,
remove it (this is called occlusion culling). The renderer must
process both otherwise even though the object that is behind is
unseen.

All of the drawing calls are much faster for opaque colors than ones with
fractional alpha values.

Perfectly horizontal lines are much faster to draw than vertical lines.
Vertical lines are slightly faster than diagonal lines.

Sequential `draw_point()` calls that have the same `z` value are
significantly optimized in order to enable efficient per-pixel graphics.

Sequential `draw_sprite()` calls that have the same `z` value and
the same clipping region are slightly optimized to enable efficient custom
map rendering and particle systems.

Numeric for loops, such as `for i < N` are slightly faster than
iterator for loops such as `for x in A`.

`with` statements are relatively slow, as are `for`-`with` loops on
large arrays.  Use them for readability on individual or small sets of
objects but not on large arrays or in loops that repeat many times.

It is slightly faster to perform math on individual elements than
vectors.  For example, `pos.x += vel.x; pos.y += vel.y` is slightly
faster than `pos += vel`. The tradeoff of expanding out math is
generally not worth the readability cost unless processing hundreds of
vectors. The performance advantage diminishes as the objects grow
larger. For example, `rgba` vectors or adding whole arrays to each
other have relatively less overhead than `xy` vectors.

Notes for Beta Testers
=====================================================================================

There is no mapping on the mobile touchscreen controls for the
"shoulder" buttons E and F.  I'm still trying to find a workable
solution on mobile. 

Fonts beginning with letters G-W do not have all button
prompts yet.

The API is mostly complete. I'm focusing on bug fixes and minor tweaks
to improve convenience. Only some minor helpers, primarily for AI,
will be added before the 1.0 release.

Expect rasterization alignment rules for triangles to change slightly
in order to better align for subpixel cases. The current sprite, map,
disk, line, and rectangle rendering alignment is final. I will add
separate functions for watertight triangle and line rasterization,
which give different results than what is typically useful for
individual primitives.

The `make_spline()` function using `"continue"` mode will change to be a
third-order curve outside of the bounds instead of a line.

IDE will receive major new features throughout and after the beta
phase. This includes editors for sprites and maps.

The Library tab of the launcher program is currently hard-coded to the
four built-in games. During the beta period this will change to show
any game that has been loaded by URL until the user explicitly "forgets"
it.

The Discover tab of the launcher program does not currently work.
It will be manually populated
later in the beta period and then during 1.0 launch. I will fill it
with games that I see announced on the
[Completed Games Forum](http://quadplay.freeforums.net/board/6/completed-games)
which are hosted online (typically using GitHub Pages). Be sure to
provide all of the metadata in your `.game.json` file and the
`label64.png` and `preview.png` images so that your game appears
correctly. Version numbers will be used to track updated games so that
they automatically return to the front of the queue after being
updated.

The package manager is not implemented and may actually be removed
instead of being implemented, depending on the needs that arise in the
beta. You can load relative URLs for scripts and assets right now. So,
the need for packages isn't urgent as you can reuse across projects
already. What packages will provide are namespaces as well as assets
bundled together with a script.

The IDE is designed to collapse gracefully so that you can use an
external editor. Here's one useful layout:

![](external-editor.png width=50% style="image-rendering:auto")

The editor on the left is emacs running in a terminal. On the right is
the browser reduced to the quadplay✜ debugging output and emulator.

Be careful to always end your *filenames* with _two_ extensions:
`.game.json`, `.sprite.json`, `.map.json`, etc. This is how the IDE
and compiler knows what type it is loading.

Take note of the 4-bit sprite
[quantizing tool](../tools/quantize.html). I find it better than the
quality produced by Photoshop for color reduction.
