</td><td>
*macOS and Linux:*

1. Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/ target="_blank") or newer
2. Unzip [<quadplay/>](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay/archive/main.zip) to wherever you want
3. Run `quadplay` from the terminal
</td></tr></table>

To make a game, select the "Tools" menu from inside the quadplay
development environment and then the "New Game" option. Look at the
Built-In Games section for more examples.

If you've worked with other scripting languages, then you may want to
read the PICO-8 section, Python section, or JavaScript section of this
document for some starting tips. 

If you're new to programming, just look at the many sample games and
examples that are included and try modifying your own copies of them.

!!! Info Pro Developers
    Experienced programmers can use external editors with <quadplay/> for both
    programming and directly modifying game and asset `.json` files by:
    <ul>
      <li>Optionally [clone the SDK with git](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay) to manage SDK upgrades</li>
      <li>Install a code editor (_[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), Vim, Emacs, etc._)</li>
      <li>Install the PyxlScript extension for your editor: _[Visual Studio Code](#advancedtools/visualstudiocode)_, _[Vim](#advancedTools/vim)_, _[Emacs](#advancedtools/emacs)_</li>
      <li>Put your games under `~/my_quadplay/`. The IDE always creates new games in the root of that path, but
          you can reorganize it to form a hierarchy to group games or manage different games
          using different version control repositories. </li>
    </ul>


On Windows, click on the shortcut on your desktop to run <quadplay/>. Or launch from the
command line on Windows CMD, macOS Terminal, or a Linux terminal with
the `quadplay` command in the root of the SDK.

Here are some examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
# Run the emulator and IDE. You can use Open Game from the Tools
# menu to load games
quadplay

# Load the games/quadpaddle/quadpaddle.game.json sample program
quadplay quad://games/quadpaddle

# Load the space.game.json game that you've made (on Mac and Linux)
quadplay ~/my_quadplay/space

# Load the space.game.json game that you've made (on Windows)
quadplay C:\Users\MYNAME\my_quadplay\space

# Load your game and allow mobile clients to connect by scanning
# the QR code displayed in the IDE (Mac and Linux)
quadplay --serve ~/my_quadplay/space

# ... Windows
quadplay --serve C:\Users\MYNAME\my_quadplay\space

# Launch quadplay as a standalone game kiosk. This is good for
# locking down public installations at a home, school, or conference
quadplay --kiosk

# Load a game from the web (their server must support CORS)
quadplay https://morgan3d.github.io/somegame/foo.game.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more advanced controls and to make the quadplay local server
visible, you can run `tools/quadplay-server` instead.

These examples assume that your directory structure is:

*****************************************************************************
*   📂 HOME (~/ on Mac and Linux, %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% on Windows)
*   |
*   +-- 📂 my_quadplay
*   |   |
*   |   '-- 📂 space
*   |       |
*   |       +-- 📄 space.game.json
*   |       |
*   ⋮       ⋮
*
*   📂 quadplay
*   |
*   +-- 📄 quadplay
*   +-- 📄 quadplay.vbs
*   |
*   +-- 📂 fonts
*   |   |

*   |   |   |
*   |   ⋮   ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 sprites
*   |   |
*   ⋮   ⋮
*****************************************************************************
[Directory structure with the `quadplay` script in the root.]

The directory and `.game.json` file do not have to have the same
name. You can list the full path to the actual game file instead.

Your games do not have to be stored in a subdirectory of the SDK.
They can be anywhere on your system.

Every time you push the Run button (F5) or Reload button (Ctrl+R) in
the emulator within the web browser, it will reload your code and
assets from disk. So, you can mix an external editor with the built-in
IDE without worrying about synchronization.

You can use the built-in assets from the developer kit, existing ones
from sites like [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org) and
[FreeSound](http://freesound.org), or create your own using:

- PNG pixel art editor for sprites and fonts (_[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), [AseSprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), Photoshop, GraphicsGale, etc._)
- MP3 sound tools (_[BFXR](https://www.bfxr.net/), [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), etc._)
- TMX map tool ([Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), [TileKit](https://rxi.itch.io/tilekit))

_People playing your game don't need Python, just a web browser. See the Deploying Games section for more information._


Workflow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should create your programs however works best for you. Here's how
I like to work in <quadplay/>:

1. I start with a project file to load standard assets from `quad://`
   and a single *mode* called `Play.pyxl` that has no sections. I write a
   little code to draw the game.

2. Pretty soon, I need some state that persists between frames, so I separate
   `Play.pyxl` into top level initialization code and a `frame` *section*. I then declare variables
   in in the top level of the mode, and as my main loop grows too long, I start to define helper
   functions there as well.

3. At some point, I'm ready for *another mode*. This is usually for
   gameplay reasons, and not polish, because it is still early in the project.
   This might be a map or inventory screen, for example. As soon as there
   is a new mode, I need to have variables that can be seen by both modes.
   So, I also create a `common.pyxl` file or other *script* to store the global
   variables. I continue this process as more modes are required, periodically
   checking the mode system diagram in the IDE to ensure that the game
   flow is what I expected.

4. As code starts to become duplicated in the modes, I move generally
   useful helper functions out to scripts. When the scripts themselves
   get long, I start grouping them by functionality. For example, `particle.pyxl`,
   `animation.pyxl`, and `hud.pyxl`.

This is a workflow that is good for prototyping, especially in game
jam and hobby projects. I feel like keeping everything as simple as
possible and then refactoring at growth points is best for
productivity.

Otherwise, it is hard to iterate in the beginning because you're stuck
with big program abstractions in what is still a small program. Many
prototypes don't go the distance to become big programs,
anyway. There's no reason to overdesign early on.

Programming Model
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **PyxlScript** programming language is designed to make compact,
readable games. It blends Python, Lua, and JavaScript
syntax. Indentation and newlines signify blocks and ends of
statements. The syntax is based on math notation and looks like
pseudocode. Variables are explicitly declared and dynamically
typed. There's lexical scope, first class functions, and literal
expressions for objects and (zero-based) arrays. It is decidedly
function-based instead of object-oriented.

Most of PyxlScript programming is typical of any imperative,
high-level language. It is similar to Python, Lua, JavaScript, C#,
and Java.

There are three special parts of the PyxlScript programming model that
are designed to simplify programming arcade games. These special
features are [*modes*](#modes), [*2.5D graphics*](#2.5dgraphics), and [*frame hooks*](#framehooks).

### Modes

Your program consists of one or more *modes* which are game states that the
player will experience. Common modes are "Play", "Title", "Inventory", "CutScene", and "GameOver". Use `set_mode()` to change which mode the program is in.
Clicking on the "Modes" label on the left side of the IDE draws
a diagram showing the modes and transitions for your program.

![Mode diagram for the Quadpaddle sample game, as shown in the IDE.](modes.png width=50% style="image-rendering:auto")

For each mode, you specify what code runs every *frame*. This is the
body of the inner loop. Modes have capitalized names and are defined
in a script file with the same name. The simplest implementation of a
mode is just this per-frame code.

The `mode_frames` variable tracks the number of frames since this mode started.
`set_mode()` changes the mode and leaves a note in the debugging output explaining
why the mode changed. It is also used by the IDE to visualize the state machine
of your program and label the transitions, as in the diagram above.
`get_mode()` returns the current mode, which acts like a special constant.

You can also separate the mode file into different sections:

- Top level: runs once when the game is first started. Usually just variable and function declarations.
- `enter`: event that runs when this mode becomes active by another executing `push_mode()` or `set_mode()`. `enter` may be followed by an argument list
   that will be filled with the values passed to `set_mode()` or `push_mode()`.
- `frame`: event that runs every frame while this mode is active. Put your drawing and simulation code here.
- `leave`: event that runs when the game changes to another mode by executing `pop_mode()` or `set_mode()` itself.
- `pop_mode`: event that runs when the game returns to this mode from another by `pop_mode()`.

Note that `leave` and `pop_mode` do not run on `reset_game()` or `quit_game()`. 

You can think of these as callbacks, although they are not regular
functions and can only be invoked directly by the console.
You may be familiar with the concept of a [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine),
also called a finite automata or flow chart. Your program is a state machine with the modes as the states.

!!! Note: Transition Hints
    The IDE automatically constructs the mode diagram from your program. It is
    [impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem) to
    do this for all programs, but it can usually do a good job. When
    the automatic algorithm misses a link, you can give it a hint
    using a commented out `set_mode()` call in your mode file.  For
    example, <span style="white-space: nowrap">`// set_mode(GameOver) because "0 lives"`</span>
    will add a link from the current mode to the `GameOver` mode.

The syntax of a mode with multiple sections is similar to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format:

1. The name of the mode on the first line
2. A line of `=`, `═`, or `⚌` characters to underline the mode name
3. The top-level code
4. The sections, each with a name underlined by `-`, `-`, `─`, `—`, `━`, or `⎯` characters

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript

Menu
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A good place to declare state only used by this mode
let selection
const choices = ["Continue", "Show Map", "Abandon Mission"]


enter(value)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Can also be enter without any arguments or parentheses

// Reset any state
selection = 0
play_sound(menuOpen)


frame
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
set_background(rgb(1, 1, 0))

// Up and down to change the choice
selection = (selection + 3 + gamepad_array[0].y) mod 3

// Draw the menu
let pos = screen_size / 2 - xy(0, 50)
draw_text(menuFont, "→", pos + xy(-50, 16 selection), #00F)
for c in choices:
   draw_text(menu_font, c, pos, #000)
   pos.y += 16

// Button press to choose
if gamepad_array[0].pressed_a:
   if selection == 0:      set_mode(Play)  because "Chose play"
   else if selection == 1: set_mode(Map)   because "Chose map"
   else:                   push_mode(ConfirmDialog) because "Chose abandon"


pop_mode(confirmed) from ConfirmDialog
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
if confirmed: set_mode(Title) because "Confirmed abandon"


pop_mode
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This is a general pop_mode handler for any mode
// that does not have a specific handler defined as 
// in the above example

leave
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
play_sound(menuClose)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[A sample in-game menu mode using all of the optional mode sections.]


If you're accustomed to object-oriented languages, then you might
think of the whole program as:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Java
public class Menu extends Mode {
   // These variables are the top-level code
   protected int selection;

   public void enter(int value) {
      selection = 0;
      play_sound(menuOpen);
   }

   public void frame() {
      selection = (selection + gamepad.y + 3) % 3; }
      drawChoices(selection);
      if (gamepad.a) {
         if (selection == 0) { set_mode(play); } ...
      }
   }

   public void pop_mode(boolean confirmed, Mode from) {
      if (from == confirmDialog) { ... }
   }

   public void leave() {
      play_sound(menuClose);
   }
}

Mode menu = new Menu();

...
menu.enter();
while (get_mode() == menu) { menu.frame(); }
menu.leave();
...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[This is the rough equivalent of the menu mode PyxlScript code in an object-oriented language. You don't write all of this boilerplate in PyxlScript!]


#### Unmatched Push and Pop Mode

Push and pop on modes aren't always paired, because sometimes an exceptional
change to state flow occurs. 

*********************************************************************
*   .-----.   push_mode(B)   .-----.   set_mode(C)   .-----.
*  (   A   )--------------->(   B   )-------------->(   C   )
*   '-----'                  '-----'                 '-----'
*********************************************************************
[Actual code executed with unmatched push/pop mode calls.]
 

For example, if mode `A` executes `push_mode(B)`, and then
`B` executes `set_mode(C)` (instead of popping), the order of events triggered will be:

1. `B: enter` 
2. `B: leave` 
3. `A: pop_mode from B` 
4. `C: enter` 

This is as if `B` had run the `pop_mode` and then `A` directly
transitioned to C.

*********************************************************************
*             push_mode(B)                  
*   .-----.----------------->.--+--.                 .-----.
*  (   A   )                (   B   )               (   C   )

### 2.5D Graphics

Graphics in PyxlScript are similar to other 2D rendering APIs. You can
set the background color, draw basic shapes and text, and render
sprites with some features such as flipping and rotation.  There's
special support for drawing whole tile maps as well.  All drawing
commands support an [*alpha channel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing) for transparency.

What is special about the 2.5D graphics in PyxlScript is that each
drawing command has an associated *z value*. If two commands are at
the same z value (after camera and transform are applied), then
whichever comes second will draw on top of the other one. Commands
that have explicit, different z values will render from low to high
values. 

The z value for a drawing command can be set using the `z`
argument. If the `z` argument is not specified, then the `pos.z` argument
is used. If there is no `pos.z` value, then the pre-transform value
of 0 is used.

This means that you can issue drawing commands in whatever order is
convenient and let the rendering system organize them as you wish.  It
also makes it easy to render orthographic games such as
[_Double Dragon_]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dragon_(video_game)"),
isometric games such as
[_Populous_]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(video_game)"),
and other games with semi-3D effects. The included
[_Speed Street_](#playable) game demonstrates this.

Although the screen is cleared to the background color every frame,
all of the drawing commands are stored for one previous frame.  This
allows dialogue and inventory screens to re-render the previous mode's
last frame using `draw_previous_mode()` so that they can render on top
of them. This rendering retains z-order, so you can even inject new
graphics in between objects from a previous mode's frozen image.


### Frame Hooks

In addition to the mode's frame code, you can dynamically register
hook functions to run at the beginning of every frame using
`add_frame_hook()`. These are useful for timers and animations. For
example, you can use this to draw an explosion every frame until it
dissipates or to shake the screen for three frames.

Frame hooks can be tied to only run in a specific mode or to run in
all modes. You can also specify a separate hook to run each frame
from the one to run when it expires.

The closest relative to frame hooks is JavaScript's `setTimeout()`
function, although it is much more limited.


### Network Multiplayer

All <quadplay/> games automatically support *shared-screen* network
multiplayer through the built-in system menu's Online options. The
programming model is identical for local and network games and the
runtime handles everything for you. There are no explicit
synchronization messages or connections required per game.

See the Network section of the API for ways that games can customize
online play. This includes simplifying the user experience for
creating and joining games and *private per-player views*.


Coming from...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some tips to get you started quickly when you're coming to
PyxlScript from other popular programming languages.

### PICO-8

If you're used to programming in PICO-8 Lua, make these changes for the
PyxlScript:

- Create a *mode* for your project.
  - Put your top-level and `_init` code into the top level
  - Put your `_update` and `_draw` combined into the `frame` section
- Declare variables with `let` and `const` instead of `local`
- Arrays start at 0
- Use `size(x)` instead of `#x`
- Use `:` between the beginning of a block and its body
- Blocks have no `end` statements and indentation is significant
- Use `:` within object literals instead of `=`
- It is safe to mutate containers inside iterator loops
- You must specify a font for `draw_text()`. [Several](assets.md.html#fonts) are provided.
- Enjoy the overloaded operators, array functions, z-order, and alpha blend


### Python

The PyxlScript language feels a lot like Python, with these changes:

- Comments begin with `//` instead of `#`
- Explicitly declare variables with `let` and `const`
- Use `size(x)` instead of `len(x)`
- Use `debug_print` instead of `print`
- Use `for low <= i < high` instead of `for i in range(low, high)`
- The `==` operator is pointer equality (Python `is`). Use `equivalent` for object structural equality tests.
- Variables have block scope instead of function scope
- Function variables have lexical scope (no `global` statement required)
- No integer division (use `floor`)
- No comparison operator chaining
- Use `keys(obj)` and `values(obj)` instead of `obj.keys()` and `obj.values()` (although you almost never need either due to the `for` loop syntax)
- Use `for value at key in obj:` instead of `for key, value in obj.items():`
- Use `iterate()` instead of `map()`, `filter()`, or list comprehensions
- Use `x = if t then a else b` for Python `x = a if t else b`
- Use `true`, `false`, `nil` instead of `True`, `False`, `None`
- Use `def foo(a, b, ...rest)` instead of `def foo(a, b, *rest)`
- Use `foo(a, b, ...rest)` instead of `foo(a, b, *rest)`
- Use `[...array1, ...array2]` or `extended(array1, array2)` instead of `array1 + array2`
- Use `{...objA, ...objB}` for Python `listA + listB` or `{**objA, **objB}`
- Use `extend(a, b)` for Python `objA.update(objB)` and `listA.extend(listB)`
- Use `extend(array1, array2)` instead of `array1 += array2`
- Use `def foo(x default y)` instead of `def foo(x = y)`
- Default function parameters are evaluated once per call instead of once per program,
  so they do not capture and share values


### JavaScript

The PyxlScript language feels a lot like JavaScript strict mode, with these changes:

- Use PyxlScript `==` in place of JavaScript `===`
- Use `:` and indentation instead of `{}` for defining blocks
- Use `def` instead of `function`
- No `;` required, except for multiple statements on the same line
- Use `size(x)` instead of `x.length`
- Use `for v at k in object:` instead of `for (k in object)`
- Use `for v in array:` instead of `for (v of array)`
- Use `for k < size(array):` instead of `for (k in array)`
- It is safe to mutate containers inside iterator loops
- There are no anonymous functions
- Function names are not lifted to the containing function's scope
- Use `x = if t then a else b` for JavaScript `x = t ? a : b`
- Use `debug_print` instead of `console.log`
- Use `a default b` instead of `a ?? b`
- Enjoy the overloaded operators for vectors


Online Multiplayer
====================================================================================

Quadplay supports safe online play for shared-screen multiplayer games
over the internet. This is similar to the Steam "Remote Play Together"
feature.

Your quadplay *Host Code* is a series of six short words generated by
quadplay. This secures your gaming session and lets your friends
connect. Only share your Host Code with people you want to play
with. You can change to a new, random Host Code at any time. It is
almost impossible for someone to guess your Host Code--they would be
more likely to win the lottery 100 times first.

Online play requires the hosting player to send their secret Host Code
to the other player _outside_ of the game. You can do this by text, email,
telephone, Discord, Slack, and so on.

The hosting player starts hosting either from the quadplay launcher's
Online tab or from the pause menu's Online entry. The other players
then connect from the launcher's Online tab or the pause menu's Online
entry. Your computer will remember the Host Codes of other computers
you have connected to recently.

Although quadplay already restricts play to people you have trusted to
exchange a Host Code with, for privacy and further safety for
children, there is no in-game text or voice chat in quadplay.
Use a third-party gaming chat service such as Discord, SteamChat, Overtone, 
TeamSpeak3, Mumble, or Slack if you wish to have text and voice chat.

You can configure a 7-letter, all capital Online Name for your
computer that is used to identify you. This will help you to know
which Host Code goes with which person, and tells the host who you are
when you connect. 

When running a kiosk or setting up a local development station on
which you wish to prevent players from accessing the online
multiplayer feature, launch the quadplay script with the `--offline`
flag.



Tools
====================================================================================

Development Environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The browser development environment supports several alternative
layouts, which are selected from the buttons on the upper right of the
screen.

I expect most experienced programmers to use external editors such as
Visual Studio Code and Photoshop and put the development environment in 
Full Screen or Test layout. Most newer programmers will
directly use the built-in integrated development environment within
the browser in the Develop and Debug modes.


![](../console/icons/ui-fullscreen.png width=32) Full Screen
: Play your game full screen. Good for playtesting.

![](../console/icons/ui-touchscreen.png width=32) Touch Screen
: Play your game with single-player mobile touch controls.

![](../console/icons/ui-test.png width=32) Test
: Run with a large emulator and the debugger visible. This is 
  good for using on the left or right half of the screen when 
  running an external editor on the other half.
  
![](../console/icons/ui-debug.png width=32) Debug
: Pixel-doubled emulator and compressed text editor. Good for
  debugging graphics code and tuning constants.
  
![](../console/icons/ui-develop.png width=32) Develop
: 1:1 pixel emulator with text editor and debugger. Good for
  working on gameplay code.
  
![](../console/icons/ui-edit.png width=32) Edit
: Full-screen code editor. Good for writing lots of code.

![](../console/icons/ui-ghost.png width=32) Ghost
: Show-off mode for livestreaming, with the full screen code
  editor and the game running behind it full screen, like a
  ghost. Press the Play button to switch input to the game
  in the background. Game touch input is obviously not available
  in this layout.


There's also a special "kiosk" mode that the `quadplay` script
can run in for removing the top control bar when running on
an arcade machine or other public display mode.


Emulator
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main tool is the console emulator, which you can launch with the
`quadplay` command at the command line.

The emulator accepts keyboard and game controller input, as well as
directly pressing its buttons on screen for mobile. On a gamepad, you
must press a button before directional input will register in a web
browser.

Pressing the "Play" button on the editor automatically transfers
keyboard focus to the emulator.

The emulator has special keyboard keys for:

- F5: run
- F6: screenshot
- F8 or Ctrl+G: start/stop recording GIF [^safariGIF]
- F10: step one frame
- Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C
- Ctrl+R or Ctrl+F5: reload

On macOS, either Control or Command can be used for "Ctrl".

[^safariGIF]: On Safari, you have to explicitly allow popups for the website for this to work.
 Go to Preferences --> Websites --> Pop-up Windows and check "allow" for `localhost` (or whatever
 address you access <quadplay/> from).


### Controls

<quadplay/> presents virtual controllers for four players. You can use
the on-screen buttons on mobile and touch screens for a single player,
a keyboard for up to two players, and connect most USB or Bluetooth
game controllers for up to four players. Physical controllers work on
all operating systems and mobile devices.

For two-player keyboard input, you can use two USB or Bluetooth
keyboards on the same computer, or have both players share a single
keyboard.

The order of physical controllers can be changed from the Controls
panel in the quadplay debugger. This is needed when configuring an 
arcade kiosk with physical positions for the players, or to allow
mixed keyboard and physical controller play.

Physical controllers give the best experience. We have successfully tested
the following, and most are autodetected by quadplay:

When trying to get a new controller working, first use https://html5gamepad.com/
to verify that your OS and web browser can see it. Then use the controller with quadplay.

8BitDo controllers work in wired, wireless, and
[XPad](https://support.8bitdo.com/xpad.html) mode. They seem most reliable on Windows and Linux.
Be sure to install the latest firmware update from the 8BitDo website.

Left and right Joy-Cons work individually in horizontal mode. They cannot be joined as on
Switch. The Switch Pro controller and the SNES and NES controllers work normally.

On macOS, Xbox wired controllers require a free,
[open source driver](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/issues). Xbox wireless controllers
do not work on Mac. Different controllers work with different browsers on macOS. For example,
Xbox 360 controllers work well with Chrome and the Nintendo SNES controller works with Safari.

On macOS PS4 controllers work in Bluetooth mode (Xbox wireless controllers may also work in
Bluetooth mode). Press the PS and SHARE buttons simultaneously
to pair. If you have any problems, delete `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist`,
shut down and then start (do not warm reboot) and then re-pair.

Stadia and [Logitech](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/products/gamepads/f310-gamepad.html) controllers
are intended to work but I have not tested them.
Please let me know if you are using them successfully.

All browsers have controller support, but Chrome seems to support the
most different controllers reliably on all platforms.

[Sample controller mappings. <quadplay/> supports many more, including JoyCons and flight sticks.]

After launching a quadplay game, you must press a button on the
controller for the web browser to allow access to it. quadplay will
automatically detect the controller and change to appropriate button
prompts for most standard devices, including Xbox, PlayStation,
Switch, Stadia, and Thrustmaster controllers. If your device is not
mapped correctly, just enter the pause menu on any game and select
"Set Controls".

I've found that the easiest Bluetooth controller to pair on macOS is a
Switch JoyCon.  Turn on Bluetooth on your Mac and open the Bluetooth
preferences. Hold the controller horizontally and hold the tiny sync
button [you have to take off the black wrist strap holder temporarily
to access this button]. You'll see the controller appear on your Mac.
Click on its name and select "connect". When you want to re-pair the 
controller with your Switch, just slide it back onto the Switch and 
it will sync.

8BitDo controllers seem to work very reliably on Windows and Linux
but are inconsistent on macOS.

The [X-Arcade](https://shop.xgaming.com/) controllers work with
quadplay.  If you have a recent (2020 or later, or with the Tri-Mode
PCB upgrade) X-Arcade controller, set XInput Mode 4 with the switch on
the
back. [Install the latest firmware](https://support.xgaming.com/support/solutions/articles/12000051593-x-arcade-tri-mode-firmware-update-download-instructions),
version 19.4 or later. On macOS, also install the open source
[Xbox360 controller](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases)
driver. The Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, and Brave) provide the most reliable
mapping. Safari and Firefox have inconsistent results.

#### Arcade Controller Mappings

The X-arcade default mapping is below. For other operating systems, browsers, or
older controllers, just use keyboard mode and program the buttons to match
the quadplay keyboard controls.

![On Windows, put your X-Arcade in X-input mode 4 and it will automatically provide this mapping.](xarcade-mapping.png style="border:none; image-rendering:auto" width=50%)

![When using an X-Arcade controller in keyboard mode 2, program it like this.](xarcade-keyboard.png style="border:none; image-rendering:auto" width=50%)

Other ten-button arcade fightsticks have two common button layouts. The
symmetric ECDF layout used by inexpensive Honcam and PXN sticks puts the
"shoulder" buttons that correspond to ⓔ and ⓕ on the left and right of
the other "face" buttons. The CDEF layout used by more expensive Mayflash,
Hori, eTokki, Qanba, and other sticks puts the "shoulder" buttons to
the right of the "face" buttons. The appropriate button prompts will
appear in quadplay for each one, but you'll have to change which fingers
you use to play games depending on the physical layout.

![Symmetric ECDF fightstick layout.<br>(Example only; this controller has not been tested with quadplay)](symmetric-arcade.jpg width=80% style="image-rendering:auto") ![Asymmetric CDEF fightstick layout.<br>(Example only; this controller has not been tested with quadplay)](right-arcade.jpg width=80% style="image-rendering:auto")

#### Dual D-Pad

When `dual_dpad` is enabled (in the game.json file or via the project checkbox),
player 1's  _physical_ controller right stick can override the 
the player 2 (`gamepad_array[1]`) _virtual_ controller D-pad. This allows
you to make digital twin-stick games that work with both default keyboard
controls and a single modern dual-stick controller.

### Analog Sticks

Quadplay exposes system features beyond the standard quadplay
capabilities using the `device_control("get_analog_axes", ...)`
function for low-level system access.

You can read analog sticks, steering wheels, foot pedals, flight
sticks, etc. directly using this API. Games that use these features
will not work on all quadplay devices. But, it is a great way to
program for a specific platform that you have in mind or have built.


### Resolution

The emulator screen tries to maintain an integer multiple of the
native pixel resolution to prevent distortion of pixel art. When
running on a very high resolution screen (greater than 2.5x), it
relaxes this constraint to use the full screen effectively.

As a result, the emulator is pixel-perfect on small displays and fills
the screen on large ones. <quadplay/> supports the following resolutions,
all with 4:4:4:4 RGBA color and 60 Hz refresh:

- 640x360 (½ 720p, ⅓ 1080p, ¼ 1440p)
- 384x224x4 = 768x448, for network multiplayer private views
- 320x180x4 = 640x360 (½ 720p), for network multiplayer private views
- *384x224* (default and recommended)
- 320x180 (¼ 720p, ⅙ 1080p, ⅛ 1440p)
- 192x112
- 128x128
- 64x64

For reference when importing assets or designing games inspired by
previous work, here are the resolutions of classic and retro machines:

<!-- - 960x160 Ableton Push 2 and 3 -->
 - 960x544 PlayStation Vita
 - 800x480 Raspberry Pi official 7" touchscreen
 - 640x480 PiBoy DMG
 - 480x320 Odroid Go Advance
 - 480x272 PlayStation Portable
 - 480x270 Hyperlight Drifter
 - 400x240 Playdate, 2DS, 3DS
 - 384x224 <quadplay/>
 - 320x240 "240p", QVGA, TowerFall Ascension
 - 320x180 Celeste and other Switch pixel art games
 - 320x200 VGA, including Amiga 500 and Commodore 64
 - 280x192 Apple II
 - 256x240 NES and TurboGrafx-16
 - 256x224 SNES
 - 256x192 Nintendo DS and Sega Master System

quantize✜
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[quantize✜](../tools/quantize.html target="_blank") is a standalone browser tool for
converting any image format that your browser can load into a sRGB8 PNG
for <quadplay/>. While the console emulator can load any PNG file, if you convert
them using quantize✜ you will have control over the color reduction process
and be able to produce much smaller files for distribution.


fontgen✜
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[fontgen✜](../tools/fontgen.html target="_blank") is a standalone browser tool for
producing rough <quadplay/> font images from fonts installed on your local
computer. You can then screen capture these and edit them in your
favorite pixel editor to clean them up.


fontpack✜
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[fontpack✜](../tools/fontpack.html target="_blank") is a standalone browser tool for
taking a font PNG file with regular tiles (such as the one produced by
fontgen✜) and packing it tightly. It will generate the output PNG
and the `.font.json` file for you.

fontpack✜ can also show what the generated characters will look like
when loaded by <quadplay/>. If the generated ones look good, _do not put
them in the .png_.  Instead, store your file with lots of empty space
so that it will compress better, and let <quadplay/> regenerate them at
load time. Only for ones where generation produces poor quality do you
need to explicitly draw them. Usually large fonts will generate
characters well but for very small fonts you must hand-tweak
characters with accents or button prompts to get a readable result in 
a few pixels.


scalepix✜
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[scalepix✜](../tools/scalepix.html target="_blank") is a standalone browser tool for
upscaling a font or sprit PNG file to twice the resolution in each
dimension, for upscaling existing assets or importing
NES, PICO8, and Game Boy assets.


(insert api.md.html here)


Libraries
=============================================================================================

In addition to the built-in API, <quadplay/> provides script assets. These are more likely
to change than the provided API and are only included in your game if you explicitly choose
to use them. These also each may have their own open source license. 

The documentation for
each library appears in the IDE "Game Documentation" section of the Help tab alongside
documentation for your own code.

Project Files
=============================================================================================

When importing assets using the IDE as JSON or raw PNG, MP3, or TMX
files, the subdirectories `journal`, `screenshots`, `metadata`,
`backlot` and `graveyard` are excluded.

!!!
    <quadplay/> supports the extended [WorkJSON](https://github.com/morgan3d/workjson) format, which permits C++ style comments, hexadecimal numbers,
    IEEE 754 constants, raw decimals, leading plus signs, trailing commas,
    and multiline backquote JavaScript strings within JSON files for convenience when
    editing and debugging. This is not legal in strict JSON and
    may be incompatible with other tools. 


Game JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project file is a JSON file describing all of the parts of the
program. The project file and all of its dependencies are reloaded
every time that you press play or reload in the IDE.

All of the `.game.json` properties can be modified through the user
interface in the IDE using buttons, textboxes, and sliders. 
Certain advanced changes require directly editing the JSON files
with the built-in editor. External editors can also be used to edit
any data and <quadplay/> will automatically sync.

An example project is below, annotated with comments explaining the
options. Project files should have the double extension `.game.json`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each game must also contain:

- 64x64 `label64.png` box art image in the same folder as the
  `.game.json` file. This is used for display in the launcher.
- 128x128 `label128.png` box art image in the same folder as the
  `.game.json` file. This is used for the open dialog.
- 1152x1120 `preview.png` image in the same folder as the `.game.json`
  file that contains 6x10 frames of 192x112 video at 20 fps (3
  seconds total) used for the preview video in the launcher.
  
You can create these images however you wish, including manually
drawing them. The IDE has some tools to automate the process.

You can create the `label128.png` and `label64.png` images by pressing
*Shift+F6* while your game is playing. It will capture a 128x128
region from the center of the screen and resize it using bilinear
interpolation to create the 64x64 image, and then save them with the
appropriate filenames in the game's directory. Edit and compress these
images as you would a sprite.

You can create the `preview.png` image by pressing *Shift+F8* while
your game is playing. It will record 3s of video, process it to the
correct resolution, and save it to disk.  Compress it as you would a
sprite. Seek to keep the total size around 100 kB for the image by
choosing content that compresses well and using a good compression
tool. If the image is much larger, then there will be delay for
players browsing your game in the discover tab.

Assets and constants are both data used by your program. Assets
include standalone JSON metadata files of their own to make them easy
to reuse between projects and are usually relatively large media
files.

Constants have metadata embedded directly in the game to reduce files
and maintenance and are usualy relatively small individual data. The
`table` and `raw` constant types can use external files as constants,
but still have metadata embedded in the game itself and use raw data
instead of media formats.


### Constants

Unlike constants declared in code, the constants in the `.game.json`
file appear in the IDE in the project list and have GUI editors. They
are immutable at runtime by the program, but can be changed by the GUI
editors for debugging and tuning at runtime.

For some formats (e.g., tables, text), there are similarities between
*constants* and *assets*. The distinction is that constants are
treated as part of the game code for intellectual property purposes,
and assets are treated as separate units that may have their own
licenses, credits, and copyrights.

Each constant has the format `"..name..": {"type": "..type..", "value": ..., "description": "..."}`.
The `description` property is optional and the `raw` type permits a `url` instead of a `value`.
Other types may have additional metadata used for the IDE.

Explicit types allow support for the full PyxlScript literal syntax
beyond that permitted natively in JSON, appropriate GUI editors, and
annotations.

The available constants types are:

- `number`
  - Decimal number, with optional double quotes
  - Unicode fraction in double quotes
  - `"nan"`
  - `"infinity"`, `"-infinity"`, `"∞"`, `"-∞"`
  - Number ending in `deg`, `°`, or `%`, all in double quotes
  - `"π"`
- `string`
  - inline or from a text file
- `boolean`
- `nil` (no `value` needed)
- vectors
  - `xy`
  - `xz`
  - `xyz`
  - Each of these may have a `"nudge"` property, which is another vector of the same type
    that specifies the amount that the IDE should shift by along each axis when nudging.
    The nudge vector expects strings of numbers or numbers directly, rather than
    recursive properties with type and value elements.
- `rgb`
- `rgba`
- `hsv`
- `hsva`
- `raw`
  - Loaded from a json or yml file or inline as a json value. When in 
    an external file, must be at top level and not nested inside an array or object.
- `distribution`
  - Like an `object`, but may contain only `number` valued properties
- `object`
- `array`
  - inline in the `value` field or from a CSV file `url`
- `table`
  - from a CSV file, interpreted as an object of arrays, array of objects, object of objects, or object of arrays
    depending on options specified
- `reference`
  - The value of a reference is the name of another constant, asset, or named
    sprite of the form `sprite_asset_name.sprite_name`. These
    can be recursive, but obviously cannot form a cycle. References must be 
    defined at top level and not nested inside an array or object. 

### `number` Constants

Number contants may have the following additional parameters
for controlling the IDE:

- `min`: Smallest value (inclusive)
- `max`: Smallest value (inclusive)
- `quantum`: Values are rounded to `round(value, quantum)`
- `scale`: Must be `"linear"` if specified
- `format`: Values are shown in the IDE using `format_number(value, format)`

### CSV Constants

A `table` or `array` entry in the game constants that uses 
a separate CSV file for the data has additional properties:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ json
{
  "type": "table",              // "table" = struct-of-structs; "array" = flat array
  "transpose": false,           // Optional, default false
  "column_type": "object",      // Optional, default "object"
  "ignore_first_column": false, // Optional, default to false. Removes the source 1st column if true
  "row_type": "array",          // Optional, default "object"
  "ignore_first_row": false,    // Optional, default to false. Removes the source 1st row if true
  "url": "somefile.csv",        // Must use a "url" property, not "value". Must be a csv file.
  "trim": true,                 // If true, trim extra whitespace. Default is true
  "set_table": false            // Only for "type":"table". If true, flatten the table as if an array, and then use the values in the array as keys of a new table that map to true
}


// Example: An array of objects, where each row is an object and the first row is the names of the properties
{"type": "table", "transpose": true, "column_type": "array"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If `type` is `"array"` then the table after being read is flattened in column-major order
into an array.

By default, tables are indexed in-game as `table[x][y]` a.k.a. `table[col][row]`.
To use `table[y][x]` a.k.a. `table[row][col]` indexing, set `transpose == true`.

The `column_type`, `ignore_first_column`, `row_type`, and
`ignore_first_row` refer to the data in the original format, before
any transpose has occured. This is consistent with named animation
indexing in sprite sheets.

If `column_type` is `"object"` (the default), then the first row of
the data is treated as property names. If `column_type` is `"array"`,
then the first row is considered element 0 of the column.

If `row_type` is `"object"` (the default), then the first column of
the data is treated as property names. If `row_type` is `"array"`,
then the first column is considered element 0 of the row.

If both `row_type` and `column_type` are `"object"` (the default),
then the top-left element is not used.

Quadplay parses values in [CSV](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180)
files with these additional rules for data types:

CSV Value                |  Quadplay Type
-------------------------|-----------------
number                   |  number
number ending in `%`     |  number (applies percentage)
date                     |  string
`TRUE` or `FALSE`        |  boolean
`$`, `¥`, `€`, `£`, or `§` + number       |  number (ignores currency unit)
double-quoted number     | number
double-quoted string equation  | string, even if number (example: `"=""00000"""`)
double-quoted text not starting with a digit  |  string (without quotes)
other text               |  string
empty                    |  (empty) string
`""` in text             |  `"`
`infinity`               |  number (`infinity`)
`-infinity`              |  number (`-infinity`)
`nil`, `null`            |  `nil`
`nan`                    |  `nan`
number ending in `deg`   |  number (in radians, same as native quadplay constants)


Double-quoted text may contain newlines.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### `raw` Format

The `raw` format allows embedding a JSON-expressible value directly. `raw` format also
supports the format <code>{"type":"raw", "url": "</code><i>your url</i><code>"}</code> instead of an inline value.
The URL must be for a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) or [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file.
Note that the `raw` format is restricted to values that are expressible in those interchange
formats and does not support the full GUI editors and other format features.

`raw` type constants with URLs must be top-level constants. They
cannot be embedded within other constants. This is required in order
to separate the asynchronous loading from constant evaluation in the
implementation and to ensure that GUI editors can be built effectively
for objects and arrays.


Debug JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When working with multiple developers on a game, it is often useful to
have slightly different settings for each developer. For example,
one developer may want a `DEBUG_GRAPHICS` constant set to `true`
while the usual value is false. Or the gameplay programmer may experiment
with different player velocity than what is in the main game branch.

One way to accomplish this is to explicitly use the built-in
`IDE_USER` constant described in the Debugging section. Another solution
is to use a `.debug.json` file.

A debug JSON file must be in the same directory as the `.game.json`
file and use the same basename. For example, if your game is
`space.game.json`, then the debug file is `space.debug.json`. 

Typically you will _not_ add the debug file to version control, so
that each developer may have their own. No `.debug.json` file is
required, and if one is present it will be ignored unless running
on a quadplay server using the IDE.

The `.debug.json` format is:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ json
{
    "start_mode": "Init",
    "start_mode_enabled": true,
    
    "constants" : {
        // Constants in the same format as in the .game.json.
        
        "player_speed": {
            "type": "number",
            "value": "3", 

            // If false, then this debug value is
            // disabled in the IDE but remembered for later
            // enabling.
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `start_mode` overrides the `.game.json` start mode, if it is present.

The constants override the equivalent constants from the `.game.json`
file (unless they are not enabled). Extra constants specified only
in the `.debug.json` file are ignored; they are not mapped at runtime.

Constant types that require external data are not supported in the
`debug.json` file. These are `raw` constants loaded from a JSON or
YAML url, `string` constants loaded from a text file url, and `table`
constants loaded from a CSV url.


Sprite JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sprite sheet JSON descriptor looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will appear as the global variable `heroSpriteSheet` in memory,
which is a 2D array of individual sprites.

!!!
   I recommend a two-step process for compressing sprites to minimize loading time
   and game size.  First, use the <quadplay/> [Quantize✜](../tools/quantize.html)
   tool to reduce bit depth. Second, use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) (macOS),
   [PNGGauntlet](https://pnggauntlet.com/) (Windows), 
   [TriImage](https://trimage.org/) (Linux),
   or [PNG Crush online](https://richardassar.github.io/pngcrush.js/)
   to improve the PNG encoding.

For a sprite sheet named `S`, individual sprites are accessed as
`S[x][y]` in game. If the sprite sheet contains a single row, then
`S[x]` is sufficient. If there's a single image, just use `S`.

Setting `transpose` to true flips the indexing to `S[y][x]`, which
is more convenient for some sprites.

Animations appear to game code as arrays of sprites that have the
following additional properties:

`extrapolate`
: Equal to `"clamp"`, `"loop"`, or `"oscillate"` as specified in the spritesheet.

`frames`
: Equal to `infinity` for `"loop"` and `"oscillate"` animations and the total
  number of 60 Hz game frames of animation for finite `"clamp"` animations.

`period`
: Equal to `nan` for `"clamp"` animations and the number of 60 Hz game frames
  for one repeat of a `"loop"` or `"oscillate"` animation.

A game may use a total of **5,505,024 pixels** of sprite memory
(10.5 MB) across **128 sprite sheets** (including fonts), each no larger than
**1024x1024**.  You can allocate this however you wish within those
restrictions.  That's equivalent to 5,376 sprites at 32x32, 21,504
sprites at 16x16, or 64 full-screen images. These are of course soft
limits because you can modify the open source emulator to remove
them. The intent of the limits is to guarantee that your programs will
work on all future implementations of the runtime: web software,
Raspberry Pi, WebGL, GLES, and desktop OpenGL and Vulkan.

If the same sprite sheet is loaded by multiple `.sprite.json` files
using the same URL then it only counts once towards the resource
limits. This allows you to pack sprites with different sizes into the
same physical sheet at no penalty and treat them as different logical
sprite sheets.

Multiple spritesheets loaded from the same sprite.json file will be
pointers to the same object, which is immutable.

There is no performance advantage or requirement for making sprites or
spritesheets even sizes or power of two sizes, although many
traditional sprites happen have sides of 8, 16, or 32 pixels. The
<quadplay/> screen resolution is designed to allow an integer number of
such tiles.

You can use the Python script `tools/sprite_json_generator.py` to generate
these json blobs for you. Use the `--help` argument for more details.


Font JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fonts have a JSON descriptor file that looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{
    "url": "sundown-7x13.png",

    // Optional copyright and license information
    "license": "Public Domain 2018 by Danika Farheed",

    // Size of the glyph bounding boxes. Include gutter pixels in the
    // char_size. The loader repacks glyphs tightly, so extra padding
    // or horizontal alignment is irrelevant at runtime (but affects
    // distribution size and loading time).
    "char_size": {"x": 8, "y": 14},
    
    // Optional, default is 0. The minimum width of a glyph for 
    // layout purposes. This can be used to create fixed-width 
    // (monospace) fonts, or to enforce minimum spacing around very
    // thin characters such as |. This is the width without an outline.
    "char_min_width": 8,

    // Spacing between letters and lines during rendering. If the
    // x spacing is zero (for script fonts), there will be no space between
    // letters or digits, but space will still be added around symbols.
    "letter_spacing": {"x": 2, "y": 3},

    // Defaults to 1 pixel
    "shadow_size": 1,

    // Zero-based Y value of the baseline relative to char_size.
    // This is one less than the "height" of the baseline because
    // of the zero based value.
    "baseline": 11,
    
    // The current format. No other is accepted
    "format": "20211015"
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can generate a default version of this JSON with the
[fontpack✜](../tools/fontpack.html) tool from a PNG image.
You can generate a PNG template for the glyphs by taking a
screenshot from the [fontgen✜](../tools/fontgen.html) tool.

By convention, the image filename contains the maximum size of the
individual glyphs, which is usually smaller than the char_size due to
gutters. The file can have any name, however.

The image must be grayscale, where white is the font character and
black will become transparent. The current implementation does not
allow shades of gray for antialiasing. The image tiles must follow
this exact character format:

![Figure [figFont]: The font character layout. To save disk space/download time and font drawing time, characters shown in magenta will automatically be generated at load time if not present in the font sheet.](font-layout.png)

At load time, many missing characters can be generated. This may not
look ideal, so use the [fontpack✜](../tools/fontpack.html) tool
when creating a font to inspect the generated characters, and hand-tune
any for which the generation is not good enough.

Also, many characters in the font sheet perform double duty and will
be used for producing similar-looking unicode characters.

Empty spaces are reserved for for future extensions.

Fonts count 1/2 as much towards the spritesheet pixel limit because
they are internally compressed to 8 bits per pixel. They still count
fully towards the maximum spritesheet dimensions. Because a font is
32x14 glyphs, this means that the largest `char_size` can be is 29x70
pixels when the `shadow_size` is one pixel.

Fonts enforce uniform width on all full-size digits 0..9 so that
numbers print in aligned columns. Avoid drawing fonts with one digit
that is larger than most of the others (usually the "4") because they
result in extra padding around all digits.

`font.line_height`
: When loaded into memory, the font object exposes a
  `font.line_height` property that is the spacing used between
  consecutive baselines. This is chosen to make typical letters well
  spaced. It may leave some symbols overlapping on adjacent lines,
  especially for decorative fonts. This is the height of the actual
  characters plus the `char_size.y` value.

Multiple fonts loaded from the same sound.json file will be pointers
to the same object, which is immutable.


Sound JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sound JSON descriptor looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{
    "url": "boom.mp3",

    // Optional base pan offset on [-1, 1]
    "pan": 0,
    
    // Optional base volume multiplier
    "volume": 1,
    
    // Optional base rate multipler
    "rate": 1,
    
    // Optional base pitch multiplier
    "pitch": 1,
    
    // Optional license and copyright
    "license": "Released into the public domain by Edouard Gauthier"
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sounds must be in MP3 format.

Multiple sounds loaded from the same sound.json file will be pointers
to the same object, which is immutable.


Map JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The easy way to create a map is within the IDE using the "Create new
asset..." option in the project. Select asset type Map and set the map
options as you wish. Once the map is added to the project, right-click
on the map in the project to open it in Tiled for editing.

![Map creation dialog in the quadplay IDE](new-map-dialog.png width=50% style="image-rendering:auto")

Multiple maps loaded from the same map.json file will produce
different map objects in memory because maps are mutable. The
spritesheets that they load will be shared if they come from the same
sprite.json files.

The map JSON descriptor looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{
    "url": "overworld.tmx",

    // Optional. Shift the map by this amount in pixels for all coordinate
    // transformations and rendering. Default = (0,0), which puts integer
    // map coordinates at the corners of tiles.
    "offset": {"x": 7.5, "y": 7.5},

    // z value of the first layer. Optional, default = 0
    "z_offset": 0,

    // Optional. Default = false. If true, flip the map
    // vertically during load so that (0,0) is the bottom
    // of the TMX map instead of the top.
    "y_up": false,

    // Optional. Default = false.
    "loop_x": false,

    // Optional. Default = false.
    "loop_y": false,

    // Optional. Default is 1.0. This is the z difference
    // between layers when rendering. Can be negative to
    // reverse layering direction.
    "z_scale": 2,

    // Optional license and copyright
    "license": "Released into the public domain by Edouard Gauthier",

    // Optional if the map only uses one spritesheet
    "sprite_url": "tiles.sprite.json"

    // If no sprite_url is specified, then an entire table
    // mapping each spritesheet referenced in the map to a sprite file
    "sprite_url_table": {
      "tiles":   "tiles.sprite.json"
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The url must reference a map file in [TMX format](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/) and
in files ending with `.tmx`. Only the following properties are currently supported:

- `Orthogonal` or `Hexagonal (Staggered)`
- `CSV` format
- `Tile layers` (other layers are ignored)
- `Embedded tileset` (a PNG reference in the TMX, _not_ a TSX file)
- For an Orthogonal map, set the map tile size equal to the tileset tile size (e.g., 32x32)
- For a Hexagonal map, set the map tile size to be 1.5x larger along the "pointy" direction (e.g., 32x48 for a 32x32 hex with points up and down)

When accessing a Hexagonal map in memory, even rows should be rendered offset by 1/2 a tile width.

![Tiled program options for creating a new map.](tiled-new-map.png width=50% style="image-rendering:auto")

The tile render order from the map is ignored.

The easiest way to create these is using the open source [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
editor, which has pay-what-you-want precompiled binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The
sprite sheet from the map file will be used for visualization if it is available in the IDE,
but map rendering is performed using a sprite sheet at runtime.

For more sophisticated map drawing, [TileKit](https://rxi.itch.io/tilekit) is a US$20 Windows
and Linux mapping program.

When drawing, layer zero for `draw_map()` corresponds to the lowest layer in Tiled and
the layer indices increase upwards.



Data JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The special data asset type allows importing a large amount of data in
an arbitrary format. It supports PNG, JPG, GIF, CSV, TXT, JSON, YAML,
and XML. Unlike a CSV, JSON, or YAML _constant_, an asset can contain
metadata, a license, and arbitrary extra properties.

Unlike a sprite, a PNG, JPG, or GIF data asset presents the raw 8-bit per
pixel data as a 2D array to the program instead of quantizing it to
4 bits per channel and only supporting PNG.

The data JSON descriptor looks like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
{
    // url can be .png, .gif, .jpg, .csv, .txt, .json, or .yml
    "url": "heightfield.png",
    "license": "your license here",
    
    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // For a .csv:

    // Can also be "type": "array" 
    "type": "table"

    // ...and all of the options for CSV table constants can be used as well
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Images are loaded as `image.color[x][y]` where `color` can be `r`, `g`,
`b`, or `a`. The values are on the range [0, 255]. Future support may
extend that range when the input has 16 or 32 bits per channel.


PyxlScript Language
=========================================================================

Numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Numbers are stored internally as double-precision (64-bit) IEEE
floating point values. Integer operators truncate the decimal places
of their arguments.

The first 2^53=9007199254740992 contiguous positive integers are
exactly representable. The largest finite representable number is
about 1.7977x10^308. There are about seventeen decimal digits of
precision on arbitrary numbers. `nan` and positive and negative infinity
are also exactly representable.

Finite decimal numeric literals contain an optional single plus or minus sign and one of:

- a series of digits, followed by an optional decimal point and a series of digits
- a decimal point followed by a series of digits
- one of the following single-character fractions, representing one-half to one-tenth: `½ ⅓ ⅔ ¼ ¾ ⅕ ⅖ ⅗ ⅘ ⅙ ⅐ ⅛ ⅑ ⅒`

Two optional suffixes are permitted:

- Percent `%` divides the number by 100
- Degrees `deg` or `°` multiplies the number by `π/180`

There are no _literals_ for not-a-number or infinity. See the Built-In Objects section
for the constant bindings that produce these values.

Hexadecimal constants are `0x` followed by series of digits 0-F or 0-f. Binary
constants are `0b` followed by a series of 0s and 1s.

Examples of legal numeric literals:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
1
-21.4
0
-0
.0
0.5
-½
+72.41
15% // 0.15
90° // ½π
45deg // ¼π
0xFF0DC
0b11000101
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No octal or exponential float notation are supported. Trailing decimal
points are not allowed. For example, `0.` is illegal.


Booleans
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The boolean literals are `true` and `false`.

Logical operators work with any values. For logical operators and flow
control, `0`, `∅`, and empty string `""` act as `false`.


Strings
--------------------------------------------------------------------

String literals are enclosed in double quotes (`"..."`). They may not contain newlines or
double quotes.

To enter a double quotation mark or slash, escape it with a slash: `"\\"` is the <code>\</code> character
and `"\""` is the `"` character.

The `+` operator performs string concatenation, coercing the right-hand argument if it is not a
string. String characters are read-only substrings accessed using zero-based array syntax.


Arrays
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Arrays are ordered sets of values. They are zero-based and have
dynamically typed elements.  Array literals are surrounded in square
brackets and separated by commas. Square brackets are also used for
l-value and r-value dereference. 

Array examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
a = [8, 4, 1]
a[0] = "hello"
debug_print(a[0])
debug_print(size(a))
a₁ += 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Negative indices are permitted on arrays but will not be reported in the length. Reading an
out-of-bounds value from an Array returns `∅`.


Objects
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objects are unordered sets of keys. Objects (also known as
dictionaries and tables in other languages) map these keys to values.
Literals are created using key-value pairs separated by a colon,
surrounded by curly braces, and delimited by commas. Object elements
can be accessed using the string name of a property in square brackets
or by a period. This allows them to act as objects/structs.

Object examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
t = {x:3, y:10}
t.x += 1
debug_print(t["x"])
debug_print(size(t))
debug_print(keyArray(t))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions are first-class values. They can be passed to and returned
from other functions, stored in data structures, and bound to
variables. Declare functions with `def` and return values from them
with `return`. Separate the argument list from the body with `:`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Multi-line function block
def solve(a, b, c):
   return ½(sqrt(b² - 4 a * c) - b) / a

// Inline function
def foo(x): x += 1; return 2 x

// Call a user function
text(foo(3))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functions create a local scope for their variables and are lexically
scoped (as in JavaScript) for free variables.

Local functions can be declared anywhere a statement can appear, and
local function definitions are efficient. It is common practice to
declare little callbacks right before they are used, as in:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript

def destroy(entity):

   play_sound(explosion_sound)
   spawn_particles(entity.pos)
   
   def cleanup(): remove_values(entity_array, entity)
   delay(cleanup, 20)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some API functions that use callbacks are `iterate()`, `delay()`,
`sequence()`, `add_frame_hook()`, `set_pause_menu()`, `ray_intersect_map()`,
and `physics_add_contact_callback()`.

There is no way to declare an anonymous function or use a function
definition as an expression. Simply declare your functions globally
or locally with a name as as statement. This improves readability.

In PyxlScript syntax, a parameter shown with `default` after it, for
example: `i default 0` indicates that this is an optional parameter and
the value after `default` be used if none is supplied. Explicitly
specifying `nil` for any parameter forces its default value.

If a function body takes too long to execute, then the interpreter
may terminate the program to prevent the game from becoming
unresponsive.

To call a function returned from an expression that ends in
parentheses, use the `call` function.




Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variable name identifiers consist of an optional leading underscore `_`, 
optional upper case delta `Δ`,
a series of Roman letters or one of the unambiguous-looking Greek letters `αβγδζηθιλμρσϕχτψωΩ` by itself, and
optionally trailing a series of digits and underscores.
The identifier also must not be a reserved word. No
other unicode characters are allowed in identifiers.

Examples of legal identifiers:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
col
screen
long_variable
longVariable
L
i
damage
Y2
Δx
θ
θ_in
_health
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables are declared to the scope of the containing block or
mode. Scope blocks are denoted by a statement ending in a colon and zero or
more indented lines.

Use `let` to declare variable names that can later be re-bound. Use
`const` to declare constants that cannot be rebound. Note that `const`
marks the *binding* as constant, but the bound value itself may be
mutated if it is an object or array.

Note that only a single variable is permitted per `let` or `const`
statement.  Multiple statements may be chained using semi-colons on a
single line, however.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const x = 7 // x may not be rebound
let y       // Declare y
let z = 9   // Declare and initialize z

// Declare and initialize two variables on the same line:
let a = [1, 2]; let b = "hello"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The variables captured by `for` and `with` and the arguments to a
`def` are bound to the scope of the body.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const scale = 2
let y = 100

for i < 3:
   y += 1
   sprite(hero[anim][0], xy(scale * i, y))

def applyScale(x):
   return x * scale

// i is out of scope here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables declared within a mode are local to that mode and
reinitialized every frame. Variables declared in a global file are
global to the entire program.

It is an error to assign to a variable before it is declared.


### Reserved Words


These are reserved tokens that cannot be used as variable names. Some
of them are keywords or built-in syntax, and some of them do nothing
now but are reserved for future use.

`and`, `arguments`, `args`, `as`, `async`, `at`, `auto`, `await`, `assert`,
`because`, `begin`, `bitand`, `bitnot`, `bitor`, `bitashl`, `bitshl`, `bitshr`, `break`,
`catch`, `class`, `const`, `cont`, `coroutine`, `continue`, `constructor`,
`deg`, `do`, `delete`, `def`, `default`, `debug_watch`, `debug_print`,
`elif`, `end`, `extern`, `enum`,
`final`, `finally`, `for`, `from`, `freeze`, `function`,
`get`, `global`, `go`, `goto`,
`has`, `HOST_CODE`,
`if`, `in`, `implements`, `inherits`, `include`, `import`, `interface`,
`launch_game`, `let`, `local`,
`nan`, `NaN`, `new`, `nil`, `nonlocal`, `not`, `null`,
`main`, `mod`, `module`, `mode`,
`or`, `otherwise`,
`public`, `private`, `protected`, `prototype`, `package`, `preserve`, `preserving_transform`,
`quit_game`,
`ret`, `return`, `reset_game`, `require`, `requires`,
`seal`, `set`, `show`, `static`, `strict`, `SUB`, `swap`, `SOURCE_LOCATION`, `SCREEN_SIZE`,
`to`, `todo`, `to_string`, `then`, `try`, `throw`, `template`, `touch`,
`until`, `use`, `using`, `unless`,
`var`, `VIEW_ARRAY`,
`while`, `with`, `when`,
`xor`,
`yield`.


Built-in functions such as `draw_rect` that are legal identifiers can be
rebound. They are not reserved. `cos`, `sin`, and `tan` by themselves
are bound to first-class functions, but the special syntax that allows
them to be invoked without parentheses on single variables is tied to
their exact names. If you rebind them, then the new functions that you
have bound will be invoked instead.



### `with` Statement

The `with` statement creates a local scope in which explicitly named
keys from an object are variables aliased to the properties on the
object.

This allows compact syntax for repeated use of those keys. It fills
the role that methods and member variables do within object-oriented
languages. The local variables shadow any global (or enclosing `with`
statement) variables.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
G = {x:1, y:2, z:0}
with x,y in G:
   x = 100
   y = 0
   z = 4

// G.x is now 100, G.y is now 0, G.z is still 0,
// and global z is now 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within the body, the local variables and the properties are true
aliases. So, `G.x` and `x` may be used interchangably within the body
in the above example.

The single-line version of the `with` statement is comparable to other
single-line flow control:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
G = {x:1, y:2, z:0}
with x, y in G: x = 100; y = 0; z = 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`with` statements can make code clean but are expensive relative to
the overhead of other statements, so avoid them for performance-sensitive
inner loops.


### `local` Statement


The `local` statement allows you to create a block without any other
bindings or flow control.  It is occasionally useful for creating
variables with a tight scope inside a long function or mode.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let x = 4

local:
   // This is a local scope and variables
   // can shadow those in the outer scopes
   let x = 7

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Comments
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments follow C/C++/Java/JavaScript syntax of `//` for single line comments and `/*`...`*/`
for multi-line comments.

`because "reason"`
: The special `because` statement allows a compile-time string comment
  to follow specific statements such as `set_mode()`. It acts as a
  machine-readable comment that the IDE will use to automatically
  annotate the program in the debug output at runtime and the mode
  diagram.



Operators
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Built-in arithmetic operators and functions are overloaded for numbers
and objects.

Some operators support a compact Unicode version and an ASCII version
that is easier to type on a conventional keyboard.

Unlike other languages, all mutating operators (for example, `++`,
`+=`, and `=`) return `nil`.


ASCII    | Unicode | Meaning
---------|---------|--
`++`     |         | increment

`-`      |         | negation
`+=`     |         | mutating addition, string concatenation
`-=`     |         | mutating subtraction
`<`      |         | less-than
`<=`     |`≤`      | less-than or equal to
`>`      |         | greater-than
`>=`     |`≥`      | greater-than or equal to
`in`     |`∈`      | `for` loop container element-of and `with` statement object
`^`      |         | exponentiation (see also unicode exponents)
`*`      |         | multiplication (see also implicit multiplication)
`*=`     |         | mutating multiplication
`/`      |         | floating-point division
`/=`     |         | mutating division
`mod`    |         | remainder (modulo)
         |`⌊⌋`     | floor function
         |`⌈⌉`     | ceiling function
`||`     |         | absolute value
         |`‖‖`     | magnitude (of a vector or array)
`[]`     |         | object/array element reference, or array constructor
`{}`     |         | object constructor (follows JavaScript syntax)
`.`      |         | object property
`()`     |         | grouping or function call
`...`    | `…`     | spread operator for arrays and objects
`bitand` |`∩`      | bitwise AND (bit set intersection)
         |`∩=`     | mutating bitwise AND
`bitor`  |`∪`      | bitwise OR (bit set union)
         |`∪=`     | mutating bitwise OR
`or`     |         | logical OR
`not`    |         | logical NOT
`and`    |         | logical AND
`bitxor` |`⊕`      | bitwise XOR
         |`⊕=`     | mutating bitwise XOR
`bitnot` |`~`      | bitwise NOT
`~=`     |         | mutating bitwise NOT
`<<` or `bitshl`   |`◀`      | arithmetic bit shift left
`<<=`    |`◀=`     | mutating arithmetic bit shift left
`>>` or `bitshr`   |`▶`      | arithmetic bit shift right
`>>=`    |`▶=`     | mutating arithmetic bit shift right
`if`...`then`...`else`| | conditional (C/Java `?:` a.k.a. "ternary" operator)
`default`|         | default value operator

Assignment and mutating operators all return `nil`; they cannot be
chained or used in expressions.

There is no logical XOR or logical shift right.

The `default` operator has the form: _expr1_ `default` _expr2_. If
_expr1_ is not `nil`, then the value of the operation is the value of
_expr1_. If it is `nil`, then _expr2_ is evaluated and the value of
the expression is the value of _expr2_. Note that the second expression
is not evaluated unless it is needed, as with `and`, `or`, and `if` operators.

The `default` operator allows compact
statements handling default arguments or out of bounds array accesses,
for example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Returns a transparent gray. Opacity is optional
// and defaults to 1
def transparent_gray(g, opacity):
  return rgba(g, g, g, opacity default 1)
  

// Print the first element of array matching target, or 
// the first element of the entire array if not found.
debug_print(array[find(array, target) default 0])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conditional operator (distinct from the `if` block statement) has
the form: `if testexpr then truevalue else falsevalue`.  Note that
there are no colons (:), because it does not create blocks. The
conditional operator is convenient when initializing constants, or
data structures. For example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const y = if x > 3 then "cat" else "dog"

spawnMonster(if pos then pos else xy(0,0))

let data = {name: if i > 2 then "Peter" else "Amit",
            height: 7}

setTarget(if ‖pos - P.pos‖ > 10 then ∅ else P)

// Because "and" and "or" operate on non-booleans, the examples
// above could have been written less clearly with alternative
// logic:

const y = (x > 3) and "cat" or "dog"

spawnMonster(pos or xy(0,0))

let data = {name: (i > 2) and "Peter" or "Amit",
            height: 7}

// Note that this one had to be restructured
// because ∅ acts as false for "and"
setTarget(‖pos - P.pos‖ ≤ 10 and P or ∅)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To nest conditionals, you must put parentheses around at least the
`falsevalue`, for example `y = if x > 3 then "cat" else (if x > 2 then
"dog" else "llama")`.

`a default b` is equal to `a` if `a` is not `nil` and `b`
otherwise. It does not evaluate `b` if `a` was not `nil`.  This is
equivalent to the JavaScript and C#
[nullish](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator)
`??` operator. Some common uses are:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript

// Default value on load
num_players = load_local("num_players") default 2

// Default value on missing object property
height = character_height[name] default 170

// Default value on going out of array bounds
vel = array[i + 2] default xy(2, 3)

// Fallback value on find() failing
debug_print(array[find(array, target) default 0])

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Spaces are not required around operators in most cases, so long as the text parses
unambiguously. For example, `1or3` is equivalent to `1 or 3`. There is no ASCII operator for
floor or ceiling; use the `floor` and `ceil` functions. There is no way to express mutating bitwise
operators using ASCII.

Behavior of these operators is consistent with the JavaScript definition of the operation
(even though JavaScript uses different operators). For example, the <b>logical</b>-AND expression
`4 and 1` evaluates to `1` because `4` is non-false and the result of non-false AND another
value is the other value.

The trigonometric functions `cos`, `sin`, and `tan` may be invoked as if they were operators
when the order of operations is unambiguous. For example, `cos a` ==> `cos(a)`, `cosβ` ==>
`cos(β)`, and `cosθ*sinφ` ==> `cos(θ) * sin(φ)`.  To avoid confusion and reserve future syntax,
they may not be invoked in this form when a high-precedence operator follows the argument. Those
operators are `.`, `[`, and exponentiation.

Note that the `call()` function can in most cases be replaced simply with the function
expression followed by arguments:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
x = (if a then abs else cos)(θ)
y = tbl["myfunc"](3, 4)
z = f(a)(b)

x = call(if a then abs else cos, θ)
y = call(tbl["myfunc"], 3, 4)
z = call(f(a), b)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Assignment and Equality

As in Python and JavaScript, all assignment operators perform pointer
assignment and all equality operators check for pointer equality. All
function call parameters are passed by pointer. Strings, `nil`,
numbers, and booleans are immutable and unique.

This means that variables will be aliased after assignment:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let v = xy(1, 2)
let k = v

k.x = 3
// v.x is 3 now
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `clone()`, `deep_clone()`, or one of the vector-specific helper
functions for copying assignment:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let v = xy(4, 5)
let k = xy(v) // copy

k = clone(v) // generic version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A global game constant that is cloned becomes mutable. There is no way
to declare immutable objects or arrays at runtime in code. `const`
makes the _binding_ constant, but has no effect on the value (as in
JavaScript).


### Exponents

The characters `⁺⁻⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹ᵃᵝⁱʲᵏⁿᵘˣʸᶻ⁽⁾` can form exponent expressions that operate as if
the `^` operator or `pow` function was invoked using those expressions as a second argument.
The entire exponent expression is implicitly surrounded in parentheses.

The variables `a`, `β`, `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `u` may appear only as single-character
variable names in exponents.

Exponentiation, including via exponent characters, may not be performed on a negative number
without parentheses. This follows the rules from JavaScript's `**` operator. For example,
`x=y-1²` is legal, but `x=y+-1²` is illegal and must be rewritten as `x=y+(-1)²` or (the
confusing and redundant expression, if that's really what was intended) `x=y+-(1²)`.


### Implicit Multiplication

Multiplication is implicit wherever a number is immediately followed by a parenthesized
expression or variable (including a function call). This also ocurrs when any exponent
appears immediately preceeding a parenthesized expression or variable, and where two
parenthesized expressions are back to back. For example,
`2x`, `x²y`, `3(x+y)`, `(2 + x) y`. 

Implicit multiplication will not occur if the expression on the left of the pair 
ends in any bracket: `| ) ] ⌋ ⌉ ‖` and the expression on the right also begins with a bracket.
For example, `(x + 1) (x + 2)` and `|y| x` are syntax errors, not implicit products.

Implicit multiplication can be used within exponents.


### Spread Operator

The spread operator (`…` or `...`) allows defining and calling
functions with a variable number of arguments and creating an extended
clone of an object or array. It is the same as `*rest` in Python and
`...rest` in JavaScript, and similar to varargs in C++ and `...` in
Java.

In a function declaration it designates the final argument as an array
of all further arguments.  For example, `def foo(a, b, …rest):` takes
any number of arguments and maps them to `a`, `b`, and then an array
`rest` of the remainder.  For example, `def bar(…args):` takes any
number of arguments and maps them all into array `args`.

In a function call or array literal, the spread operator expands an array as if its elements had
been entered inline. So, `bar(…a)` calls a function with all of the arguments from array `a`.
`[1, 2, …a, 10]` creates an array that begins with 1 and 2, then has all of the elements of `a`,
followed by the number 10.

For objects, `{a:1, b:2, …rest}` creates the object `{a:1, b:2}` and then
creates a new extended version in which the properties of `rest` are added,
overriding any with the same name in the original object (as with the `extended()` function).
This is helpful for the case of calling a function with an args object:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
const text_args = {color: #FFF, x_align: "center", font: roman_font}

draw_text({text: "Hello", pos: xy(10, 100), …text_args})
draw_text({text: "World", pos: xy(10, 120), …text_args})
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


### Built-in Objects

The following are built-in constants and special zero-argument
operators. They are not variable names and thus cannot be
redefined. Several have both unicode and ASCII names.

Literals (replaced by the parser at compile tile):

Symbol         | ASCII           | Value
---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------
`ε`            | `epsilon`       | `0.000001`
`π`            | `pi`            | `3.141592653589793115997963468544185161590576171875`
`∞`            | `infinity`      | infinity
               | `nan`           | floating-point "not-a-number" value
`∅`            | `nil`           | ("undefined")


The following are lowercase because they contain values that can change
without game code specifically triggering that:

Symbol         | ASCII           | Value
---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------
`ξ`            | `random()`      | random number on [0, 1), resampled every time the expression is used
               | `gamepad_array` | array gamepad of objects
               | `touch`         | the object for tracking touch and mouse input
               | `joy`           | shorthand for `gamepad_array[0]` (deprecated)


These have values that will not change unless game code specifically
invokes a routine to change them, such as `set_screen_size()` (or if
the player uses the system GUI for `HOST_CODE`):

Symbol         | ASCII           | Value
---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------
               | `CREDITS`       | object of credit and license statements from assets and code
               | `HOST_CODE`     | string that is the code guests can use to connect when hosting
               | `SCREEN_SIZE`   | the size of the full screen in pixels, defaults to `xy(384, 224)`. See also `VIEW_ARRAY[0].size`
               | `VIEW_ARRAY`    | array of corner rects for host and each guest's view in private view online multiplayer. See `set_screen_size()`
               | `CONSTANTS`     | an object mapping all game-specific constants to their values
               | `ASSETS`        | an object mapping all game-specific assets to their values
               | `QUADPLAY_INFO` | an object with properties about the runtime: `{version}`
               | `SOURCE_LOCATION` | an object that has properties `{url, filename, line_number}` from its location in the source code
               
               


Loops and Flow Control
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whitespace is significant, as in Python. A block is a line ending with a `:`
whose body is indented. All blocks create a new scope line (unlike Python).

The flow control statements are:

- Blocks:
  - `if` conditional with optional `else` and `else if` clauses
  - `while` loop
  - `until` loop
  - `for` loop
  - `for-in` loop. _See also the `iterate()` function_.
  - `for-with` loop
  - `break` and `continue` within loops
  - `preserving_transform` and `local`, which do not have branching flow
    but do create local scopes
  - `def`, which creates a local scope for a function but does not execute
    immediately
- Modes:
  - `set_mode(ModeName)` to switch game modes
  - `push_mode(ModeName)` and `pop_mode()` to temporarily
     enter a mode game mode
- Game:
  - `reset_game()` to reset all state and restart the game.
  - `quit_game()` to end the current game and return to the launcher.
  - `launch_game(url)` to launch a different game.

`set_mode()`, `push_mode()`, `pop_mode()`, `reset_game()`, `quit_game()`, and `launch_game()` may be
followed by the keyword `because` and a reason that is a compile-time string. For example, `quit_game() because "lives = 0"`.
The reason allows the IDE to label the transitions on the mode diagram for the game.

There is no switch, do loop, goto, or try/catch.

For flow control purposes, the empty string, 0, and `∅` are false.  All other objects (including empty data structures) are true.

Multi-line `if` statements may be followed by `else:` and `else if ...:` clauses. These must always be
multi-line.

Single-line `for`, `if`, `while`, and `until` statements are
permitted. There can be multiple single-line expressions on the same
line. No `else` is permitted with single-line `if` statement.

In any loop, `break` immediately terminates the tightest enclosing loop
and `continue` immediately begins the next iteration of the tightest
enclosing loop.

`while` and `until` loops evaluate the condition at the top of the loop for every
iteration.

The `until` loop is a `while` loop with an inverted test:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
until x == "end":
  x = find_next(x, data)


// Is the same as:
while x != "end":
  x = find_next(x, data)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### `&` Elision 

Trivial blocks can increase indentation so much that code is hard to
read because it extends too far to the right. All blocks except for
`else` can be elided with an immediately-previous block to avoid
excess indentation.

To elide blocks, leave the trailing `:` off the outer block and begin
the inner block with `&` at the same indentation level:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
for x < 3
& for y < 3:
& for z < 3:
    debug_print(x, y, z)
    
    
def player_update(player)
& preserving_transform
& with angle, pos, vel, gamepad in player:
    
    vel = lerp(vel, gamepad.xy, 10%)
    if ‖vel‖ > 0: angle = xy_to_angle(vel)
    pos = loop(pos + vel, xy(0, 0), SCREEN_SIZE)
    
    set_transform(pos)
    draw_sprite(arrow_sprite)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


### `for` Loop

Numeric `for` loops increment by 1 each iteration and always count up. The loop variable must
be on the left-side of a single comparison loop expression or the center of a multi-comparison
expression.

The iteration variable in any `for` loop is freshly bound for each iteration. This means that
if it is captured by a function as in:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let array = []
for i < 3
   def capture(): return i
   push(array, capture)

for f in array: debug_print(f())
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

that the value will reflect the time of the capture. This avoids many
common bugs when using first class functions with loops.


`for` loops evaluate the bounds once, before the first iteration.

The Java/C++ equivalents of `for`-loop conditions are:

<quadplay/>           | Java/C++
----------------------|------------------------
`for i ≤ k`           | `for (i = 0; i &lt;= k; ++i)`
`for i &lt; k`        | `for (i = 0; i &lt; k; ++i)`
`for 4 ≤ i &lt; k`    | `for (i = 4; i &lt; k; ++i)`
`for 4 &lt; i &lt; k` | `for (i = 5; i &lt; k; ++i)`


The comparison operators in a `for` loop declaration are an overloaded
syntax for comparison operators (just as many languages overload the
`=` operator for `for` loops).  They have the lowest precedence. For
example, `for i &lt; a or b:` is equivalent to `for i &lt; (a or b):`.  To use
regular comparison operators within `for` loop preamble, you *must*
use parentheses to make the parsing unambiguous, for example, `for i
&lt; (a &lt; b):`.


### `for-in` Loop

Container iteration `for` loops iterate over the keys of a object, the
characters of a string, or the elements of an array. 

The main variations of a `for-in` loop are:

- `for value in array:`
- `for value in object:`
- `for char in string:`
- `for value at index in array:`
- `for char at index in string:`
- `for value at key in object:`

The value variable is bound with `let`, so assignment to the value
variable is legal but will not affect the underlying value in the array.

`for-in` loops evaluate the container expression once, before the
first iteration.

It is illegal (and will usually result in an error) to add or remove
values from the container of a `for-in` loop. This semantic avoids
confusing situations for the programmer and is necessary for
performance optimizations in the iterator implementation. Changing
the order of values is legal, but discouraged because the iterator
will touch each slot in order and will skip or duplicate values if they
change slots. Writing to the current value is legal and frequently useful.

If you would like to add or remove from the container, transform your code from
`for x in container:` to `for x in clone(container):`. Cloning is
fairly fast in PyxlScript. Or, use the syntax
`let i = 0; while i &lt; size(container): let x = container[i] ... ++i` and account for the
index and size changes in your own iteration.

The Java/C++ equivalents of `for-in`-loop conditions are:

<quadplay/>           | Java/C++
----------------------|------------------------
`for x ∈ S`           | `for (x : S)`


### `for-with` Loop

You can combine a `for` and `with` statement together by chaining `∈`
expressions, in what is called a `for`-`with` loop. The properties
exposed by the `with` are references to the actual values and can be
mutated directly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
for x,y ∈ point ∈ set:
   ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

is the same as:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
for point ∈ set:
   with x,y ∈ point:
      ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `for`-loop variable (in this case, `point`) cannot be the same as
any of the `with` variables (in this case, `x` and `y`).


The variable list in a `for`-`with` or `with` expression can be split
across multiple lines by breaking after commas:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
for health, power,
    stamina in character:
   health += stamina * power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



### Examples

#### `for` loop variations

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
// Iterate over each current enemy once, destroying those
// that overlap the missile
for enemy in clone(enemy_array):
    if overlaps(enemy, missile):
        remove_value(enemy_array, enemy)
        

// Regenerate hit points for every player
for health, regen_rate in player in player_array:
    health += regen_rate


// Position each equally-spaced satellite
for satellite at i in satellite_array:
    const a = i * 360deg / size(planet_array)
    satellite.pos = xy(cos a, sin a) * ORBIT_RADIUS


// Iterate over an object's keys
for rating at stat in player.stats:
    draw_text(font, stat + ": " + format_number(rating, "%"), pos, #FFF)
    pos.y += font.line_height


// Iterate over an object used as a set
already_visited[current_room] = true

for room_name in already_visited:
    draw_text(font, room_name, pos, #FFF)
    pos.y += font.line_height
    

// Make a segmented-body centipede move
if joy.x or joy.y:
    // Don't use += because the loop passes objects instead of copying them
    centipede[0] = centipede[0] + joy.xy
    for 0 < i < size(centipede):
        centipede[i] = centipede[i - 1]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[`for` loop examples]


#### Array Iteration

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let names = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]

// Iterate over array elements
let pos = xy(½ SCREEN_SIZE.x, 10)
for planet in names:
   pos.y += draw_text(font, planet, pos, #f)

// Iterate over values and modify (this is safe, no elements will be
// skipped. You can even remove elements ahead of the iterator and
// they will still be processed)
for planet in names:
   // Remove any name with an "a" in it
   if find(planet, "a") ≠ ∅: remove_values(names, planet)

   // Add some random moons...the current loop will not
   // iterate over these, but they are immediately visible
   // in the array.
   if random() > 50%: push(names, planet + " moon")

// Iterate over array keys
pos = xy(½ SCREEN_SIZE.x, 10)
for i < size(names):
   pos.y += draw_text(font, names[i], pos, #f)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#### Object Iteration

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let poemBy = {
   Angelou: "Still I Rise",
   Frost: "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening",
   Dickenson: "Because I could not stop for Death",
   Whitman: "Leaves of Grass",
   Hughes: "Montage of a Dream Deferred",
   Williams: "In the American Grain",
   Yeats: "Sailing to Byzantium",
   Browning: "How Do I Love Thee?"
}

// Iterate over array elements
let pos = xy(½ SCREEN_SIZE.x, 10)
for author in poemBy:
   pos.y += draw_text(font, poemBy[author] + " by " + author, pos, #f)

// Iterate over values and modify (this is safe, no elements will be skipped)
for author in poemBy:
   // Remove this entry if it contains an "a" in the value
   if find(poemBy[authpr], "a") ≠ ∅: remove_key(poemBy, author)

let spots = [xy(1, 1), xy(100, 2), xy(10, 20), xy(50, 20)]

for x, y in S in spots:
   // Remove any element that is higher than 15
   if y > 15: remove_values(spots, S)

let i = 0
while i < size(spots):
   // More efficient O(1) removal without preserving order
   // if spots is *really* long
   if spots[i].x > 15: fast_remove_key(spots, i)
   else: ++i
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Debugging
---------------------------------------------------------

There are two special forms for debugging that can be enabled or
disabled at runtime for efficiency on the Output pane. These are not
functions and cannot be passed as values like functions or stored in
data structures.

`debug_print(msg)` sends text output to the IDE Output pane. It runs
`unparse()` on `msg` if it is not already a string. These statements
are automatically removed from the program when debug printing is
disabled.

`assert(condition)` or `assert(condition, msg)` halts program
execution if `condition` is false. The `msg` is evaluated regardless
of the value of condition. These statements are automatically removed
from the program when assertions are disabled.



Multiline Expressions
---------------------------------------------------------------

Newlines end PyxlScript expressions, unless there are unbalanced
brackets (), [], {}. This allows you to spread function calls, array
literals, and object literals over multiple lines.  For example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyxlScript
let player = {
   center: xy(100, 40),
   angle: 45deg,
   inventory: ["hat", "sword",
      "money", "watch", "apple"]
}

let x = (43 +
   17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an error occurs in a multiline expression, the line number reported
will be that of the beginning of the expression. If a line contains
the end of a multiline expression, it may not also contain multiple statements.



Symbols
---------------------------------------------------------------

The <quadplay/> IDE supports autocorrect for typing the optional special
symbols such as `nil` --> `∅`, `1/2` --> `½`, and `>=` --> `≥`. To generate
paired symbols, type the name of the corresponding function without arguments.
For example: `floor()` --> `⌊⌋`, `ceil()` --> `⌈⌉`, `magnitude()` --> `‖‖`,
and `abs()` --> `||`.

For convenience when using an external editor or typing the full set
of characters supported by fonts into strings on a US-EN keyboard, you
can also copy and paste from here:

[Button prompts. Device-aware and full button prompts
are available via the `prompt` property of `gamepad_array[]` elements]


Note that the superscripts `ᵈᵉʰᵐᵒʳˢᵗ` are legal in text strings but
not as code. These are present specfically to support ordinals such as
"1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ, 4ᵗʰ, 1ᵉʳ, 1ʳᵉ, 2ᵉ, 2ᵈ, 2ᵈᵉ, 1ᵒ, 1ᵃ, …" in
various languages.

The encircled characters and arrows are intended for use as button
prompts.  The characters `Ⓞ ⍍ ▣ ⧉ ☰` are drawn in <quadplay/> fonts to
represent the buttons with approximately those symbols on PlayStation
and Xbox controllers. The `ⓧ` character is drawn to ambiguously
represent the "X"/cross buttons on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo
controllers. Note that the preferred way of generating button prompts
is using the `gamepad.prompt` object with the string `replace()`
function, rather than hardcoding.


Version Control
====================================================================================

<quadplay/> is designed to work well with version control systems such
as git, svn, Perforce, etc. The metadata and project files are all
simple JSON text files and assets are all common binary formats.  No
hidden directories or temporary files are generated that could confuse
a version control system.

If you use git in particular, there is additional built-in support for
simplifying workflow. The "Git Sync" button appears at the bottom of
the project tree when <quadplay/> detects that your game is stored in
a git repository. 

Pressing the "Git Sync" button will download changes by others from
the repo on the current branch to your local machine. These will be
merged into any changes you have made. If there was a substantial
merge, then you should probably test the game before proceeding
further.

If you have changes of your own, <quadplay/> will ask if you want to
upload them. If you choose to upload, it will prompt for a commit
message.

Sometimes a merge will produce a conflict. This happens when both you
and your collaborator changed the same line of a file in different
ways, or edited the same art asset. If a merge conflict occurs, you
will be presented with the following choices:

- Prefer Mine: Merge everything, and on lines where there is a 
  conflict replace their changes with yours.
- Prefer Theirs: Merge everything, and on lines where there is a conflict
  replace your changes with theirs.
- Undo Sync: Stop the merge and put all of the files back the way they
  were before you pressed "Sync". You can then choose to address
  the problem with command line tools or ask a collaborator for help.

For advanced git users, all of the git commands used and their outputs
are shown on screen. You can also freely mix git command line or other
GUI git tools with the built-in git support (although don't try it
_while_ a command is being processed).


Advanced Tools
====================================================================================

In addition to the friendlier browser-based tools from the Tools
menu, the distribution includes command-line tools for experienced
programmers. These support external editors, running the server
locally, and performing some IDE tasks at the command line. Unlike the
IDE, some of these have additional dependencies and assume that you
know how to install those on your own.


Local Emulator
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can launch the IDE on your local machine. This allows you to run
without a network connection and to work with local files instead of
Google Drive ones for the GitHub-hosted IDE.

Launch your program in the emulator and debugger from the command line
on Windows, macOS, or Linux with the `quadplay` command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
# Load the games/quadpaddle/quadpaddle.game.json sample program
quadplay quad://games/quadpaddle

# Load a mygames/space/space.game.json game that you've made
quadplay mygames/space

# Load from the internet (server must support CORS)
quadplay https://morgan3d.github.io/somegame/foo.game.json

# Just run the emulator. You can modify the URL in your browser
# to add "?game=" and the game's URL or relative path
quadplay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run `quadplay --help` to see more options for the script.

These examples assume that your directory structure is:

**********************************************************
*
*   📂 quadplay
*   |
*   +-- 📄 quadplay
*   |
*   +-- 📂 fonts
*   |   |
*   |   ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 games
*   |   |
*   |   +-- 📂 quadpaddle
*   |   |   |
*   |   |   +-- 📄 quadpaddle.game.json
*   |   |   |
*   |   ⋮   ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 mygames
*   |   |
*   |   '-- 📂 space
*   |       |
*   |       +- 📄 space.game.json
*   |       |
*   |       ⋮
*   |
*   +-- 📂 sprites
*   |   |
*   ⋮   ⋮
**********************************************************
[Directory structure with the `quadplay` script in the root.]

The directory and `.game.json` file do not have to have the same
name. You can list the full path to the actual game file instead.

Every time you push the play button (F5) or reload button (Ctrl+R) in
the emulator, it will reload your code and assets from disk.

By default, `quad://` assets are cached for fast reload peformance. To
disable this behavior, force a reload of the entire page with
shift+browser reload button, or remove `&fastReload=1` from the URL.


Visual Studio Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visual Studio Code natively supports the `.json` files. To configure it with
PyxlScript file support as well:

1. Run Visual Studio Code
2. Press F1 and type `install code` and then press enter
3. Open a terminal and change directory to `quadplay/tools`
4. At the command line, run `code --install-extension vscode-pyxlscript.vsix`


Vim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the PyxlScript mode for Vim, you'll need to modify your .vimrc.

If you're using a plugin manager like [dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
call dein#add("path/to/quadplay/tools/vim-pyxlscript-syntax", {'frozen':1})
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to directly copy the files into your ~/.vim directory, make sure you copy (or symlink) all the files into the corresponding directories like they structured in the plugin.

[`pyxlscript.vim`](../tools/pyxlscript.vim)


Emacs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the PyxlScript mode for Emacs, add the following lines to
your `~/.emacs` file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Lisp
; Optional if you don't want to copy the files:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "path/to/quadplay/tools"))
(autoload 'rainbow-mode "rainbow-mode")
(autoload 'pyxlscript-mode "pyxlscript-mode")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.pyxl\\'" . pyxlscript-mode))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that you have to put the real path in for the `"path/to/quadplay/tools"`,
such as `~/quadplay/tools`, or wherever you installed quadplay to.


Other Editors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fortunately, PyxlScript syntax is very close to Python syntax. If you
tell your editor to treat `.pyxl` files as Python files, then it will
probably handle indenting and most keywords correctly. Comments are
the one element that will probably confuse your syntax highlighter.


Command-Line Tools
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`quadplay`
: Launches the emulator from the command line on any operating system.
  Requires Python. See the arguments above. (Depending on operating system,
  this command may run the `quadplay.cmd`, `quadplay.vbs`, or `quadplay`
  script.)

`quaddepend.py`
: Prints dependencies of a `.game.json` file, recursively. Run the script  with `--help` to
  see the arguments. Run as `tools/quaddepend.py ...` or `python3 tools/quaddepend.py ...`
  from the main quadplay directory.

`export.py`
: Export a static HTML site for a single game, either lightweight by referencing
  `https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay` or standalone by embedding a full copy of
  the emulator. Run the script with `--help` to see the arguments.

  Run as `tools/export.py ...` on Linux and macOS, or `py tools/export.py ...` on Windows
  from the main quadplay directory. This script itself depends on `tools/quaddepend.py`.

`project_linter.py`
: Linter for quadplay projects.  Intended to help when finalling a project, it
has a number of checks including:

- unused assets
- unused constants
- missing licenses
- missing quadplay metadata (preview.png, etc)
- report of licenses used in a project (use the --license-audit flag)

For a full list of features, use the --help argument.  Run it in the same
directory that containst the game.json for your project.

`sprite_json_generator.py`
: Generator for `.sprite.json` files. Requires Python and PIL.

  If you are exporting from aseprite, use the following settings with `sprite_json_generator.py`:

  - Sheet type: "by row" (quadplay doesn't support animations wrapping around image rows
  - Constraints: "None"
  - Sprite:
      - Layers: "visible layers" (quadplay doesn't support layers")
      - Frames: "all frames" (unless you only want some frames)
      - "split layers" should be unchecked (OFF)
      - "split tags" should be checked (ON)
  - Borders: 
      - "spacing", "trim", and "extrude" should all be off (set to 0)
  - Output:
      - "export json": yes and under "meta" for this:
      - "layers" should be off
      - "frame tags" should be checked
      - "slices" should be off
      - "Array" (_not_ "Hash") mode
      - Output file and JSON Data should be checked (these are what you feed into sprite_json_generator)
  - "open generated sprite sheet" is up to you, if you want it to show you the sprite sheet when its done.

  If you export with these settings, you can pass the generated json file to the  sprite_json_generator program and it will convert the tags and sprite size
  automatically from the file.

  Note that while aseprite supports sprites of varying size, quadplay does not.


`quadplay.html`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `quadplay.html` application launched by the `quadplay` script accepts the following
HTML query arguments:

`IDE`
: If set, load in development mode with access to the full IDE and stop and pause
  buttons. Cannot be set with `kiosk`

`fastReload`
: If `1`, do not force reloading of `quad://` files from disk but instead allow
  browser caching. Those resources are unlikely to change (unless you are modifying
  quadplay itself!), so this speeds up game reloading, especially for music.

`game`
: URL of a game to load, which can be relative to the `quadplay` script.

`mode`
: Initial mode to display: `Maximal`, `Emulator`,`IDE`, `Test`, `WideIDE`, `Editor`, `Ghost`, or `DefaultWindow`.
  The default is `IDE` when running the IDE and otherwise `Maximal` for non-touch screens
  and `Emulator` for touch screens. `DefaultWindow` reverts to the default but suppresses
  automatic full-screen on launch when not on a touch screen.

`nofs`
: If `1`, do not try to 

`kiosk`
: If `1`, hide the entire menu bar. Cannot be set with `IDE`

`nosleep`
: If `1`, prevent sleeping in kiosk and normal mode, no matter
  what the autosleep setting is.

`quit`
: What the "quit to system" menu option in the pause menu and the `quit_game()` function do:
  - `launcher`: Return to the launcher or IDE. This is forced
     when `IDE=1`. Default when `game` is not specified.
  - `close`: Close the browser tab or standalone app. Default
     when `game` is specified and `IDE=0` and `kiosk=0`. Unless the
     page was opened by JavaScript from another page, browsers
     prohibit closing the tab from code and this will instead
     set the page to blank.
  - `none`: Do not offer a quit option to the player. Default when
    `game` is specified and `kiosk=1`
  - `reload`: Reload the iframe or tab that the game is in, 
     sending it back to the welcome screen. This value prevents
     the game from launching in fullscreen until the first press,
     which is good for games embedded in a page and is the way
     that exported web games are configured.

`nativeapp`
: If `1` and running on a quadplay server, quitting the IDE shuts down
  the server.
  
`update`
: If `1` and running on a quadplay server, check for newer versions of
  quadplay.


Physical Consoles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Build

I expect most people will use <quadplay/> on phones, laptops, and desktops
as a _virtual_ console. But, if you have some maker experience you can make a
_real_ <quadplay/> console.

If you want an arcade form factor, then a <quadplay/> arcade cabinet
can be built with some carpentry and any low-cost PC and display, or
by purchasing some (expensive!) pre-built arcade cabinets.

#### Processor

Any Mac, Windows, or Linux computer can be used to power a <quadplay/>
physical build. An old laptop often works well. Alternatively, an embedded
processor can be used.

The
[Rasberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/)
is a complete computer for only $70 that can run <quadplay/> and plug
directly into a television or monitor.

![Cort Stratton's [Rec Room Xtension/(https://recroommasters.com/product/upright-4-player-arcade-machine/) <quadplay> arcade cabinet powered by Raspberry Pi 5.](postgoodism.jpg width=50%)

With a 3D-printed case and some Bluetooth or wired game controllers,
you can build your own <quadplay/> retro mini console to connect to a TV
or monitor. [Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
and [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) cost less than $100 and can
power such a box using Linux and Chromium. Both will hit 60 Hz for most games, and can easily run at
30 Hz for all games (<quadplay/> handles framerate scaling for you seamlessly,
so you won't even notice most of the time). 


![Quadplay mini-console built by Morgan McGuire from a Jetson Nano with a 3D-printed case, USB Xbox 360 controller, and small external monitor.](nano-arcade.jpg width=50%)

I've built Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi consoles and the result is satisfyingly comparable to
the Nintendo [NES Classic Edition](https://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/),
[Super NES Classic Edition](https://www.nintendo.com/super-nes-classic/), 
Sega [Genesis Mini](https://genesismini.sega.com/), and
PlayStation [Classic](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/explore/playstation-classic/) devices. The big difference
from commercial mini retro consoles is that you can program your own quadplay console. The commercial consoles
only play their own games.

![Self-contained quadplay console built by Morgan McGuire from a Raspberry Pi and standard screen case, with Bluetooth controllers.](rpi-arcade.jpg  style="image-rendering:none" width=50%)

My Raspberry Pi 4 software configuration from the default Raspberry Pi
OS instalation is simply:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
sudo apt install snapd
sudo reboot

# After reboot:
sudo snap install core
sudo snap install chromium
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-www-browser x-www-browser /snap/bin/chromium 200
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an alternative using the provided Debian package for automatic
management, but gives an older version of Chromium that is slower:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
sudo apt install chromium
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-www-browser x-www-browser /usr/bin/chromium-browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


For the Raspberry Pi 400 (the model built into a keyboard), I also 
[overclock to 2 GHz](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2020/11/overclocking-the-raspberry-pi-400/).

A Jetson Xavier, Intel NUC, or old PC/Mac is a more expensive device
for powering a mini console, but has a lot more graphics power than an
embedded processor and will comfortably run all games at 60 Hz.


#### Arcade Controller

When you're color coding the physical controls for a full four-player setup, the standard
<quadplay/> arcade player colors and physical layout order is: P3 Yellow, P1 Magenta
("pink"), P2 Cyan ("blue"), P3 Lime ("green"). Graphically:

<center>
<table style="font-size:200%; font-weight:bold; width:300px; text-align:center; margin: 15px; border-collapse: separate; border: 2px solid #000; padding: 8px; background: #333">
<tr valign="center"><td colspan=4 style="border: 2px solid; border-radius:8px; background: #000; height: 200px">SCREEN</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="color:#fd3">*P3*<span style="font-size:50%"><br>#fd3</span></td>
<td style="color:#f5a">*P1*<span style="font-size:50%"><br>#f5a</span></td>
<td style="color:#0af">*P2*<span style="font-size:50%"><br>#0af</span></td>
<td style="color:#4e4">*P4*<span style="font-size:50%"><br>#4e4</span></td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan=4 style="border-top: 2px solid #000"><br><br></td></tr>
</table>
</center>

There are a lot of physical
[arcade controllers](https://shop.xgaming.com/products/x-arcade-dual-joystick-usb-included)
available at reasonable prices for building out the controls without
needing any custom electronics. Note that <quadplay/> supports (but does
not require) a touch screen or mouse, which will not be available on a
normal cabinet setup. One alternative is to use a small trackpad
mounted on top of the joystick controller.

![Arcade station built by Morgan McGuire running quadplay on a 2012 MacBook with an X-Arcade Dual controller.](xarcade-arcade.jpg style="image-rendering:none" width=50%)


![Arcade station custom built by Nick Porcino running quadplay on Raspberry Pi](arcade.jpg style="image-rendering:none" width=50%)

For arcade configurations, the order of the physical controllers in
the `gamepad_array[]` matters because they are at fixed locations. The default
order of controllers is set by the operating system. From the Controllers screen of
the in-game pause menu or the Controls tab of the
IDE's debugger, you can bring up the quadplay dialog to change this order.

When building your own controller, ensure that it maps correctly using the online tool at 
https://html5gamepad.com/. The specific mapping between HTML buttons and <quadplay/> is:

<quadplay/>            |   HTML Gamepad
:-------------------:|:-------------------------------:
Analog x-axis        | axis 0 (left is negative)
Analog y-axis        | axis 1 (forward is negative)
ⓐ                    | button 0
ⓑ                    | button 1
ⓒ                    | button 2
ⓓ                    | button 3
ⓔ                    | button 4
ⓕ                    | button 5
ⓠ                    | button 8
ⓟ                    | button 9
D-pad <big>⍐</big>   | button 12
D-pad <big>⍗</big>   | button 13
D-pad <big>⍇</big>   | button 14
D-pad <big>⍈</big>   | button 15

<quadplay/> automatically maps the analog stick into D-pad inputs as
well as providing analog access under `device_control()`.

See the Arcade Controller Mappings Section for more detail on some common
arcade/fighting game controller mappings.

[Sample layouts for physical controller buttons on arcade sticks]

If you have the option to choose your button layout and mapping, then
try to match one of the versions shown above.
Specifically, games are designed for the ⓔ button to be placed where it can
be easily held while using the main buttons and stick. For example, 
as a hat button on the stick or under the right thumb or pinkie. The
ⓕ button should be placed where it can be used similarly, but ⓔ should
be the more convenient of the two and favor the left side. Note the positioning of the
player 1 and 2 ⓔ and ⓕ on the keyboard compared to on a NES-style gamepad...the
keyboard controls place these buttons _lower_ than on a gamepad, so that they
are in reach of the pinkies for ease holding down. They are not "shoulder"
buttons, even though that is the best location for them on a physical controller.

#### Display

For a physical cabinet, a 24" screen will match a
traditional arcade size. For a handheld or mini installation, the screen
size is constrained by your form factor. Anything larger than 5" will
be easily readable even for the smallest 4-pixel text (and most quadplay
game text is 8 pixels high).

<quadplay/> has a default 16:9 screen resolution. However, aspect
ratio is not as important to image quality as display that can be
filled with integer multiple of 384x224 resolution.

I recommend using a 1280x720 ("720p"), 1600x900, 
1920x1200 ("16:10 WUXGA"), or 
2560x1440 ("WQHD 2K") resolution display. 
A 2560x1440 display can be run at the OS level in 1280x720
resolution to reduce GPU load for a low end or embedded GPU. 
Any display will scale down to 60 Hz refresh,
so refresh rate is not a consideration.

Those resolutions can efficiently fill the screen with integer pixel
scaling. For 27" monitors, these cost around $200 new as of 2025 but
can often be found used for less (or free) as most people have
upgraded their computers to higher resolutions.

If you are not a purist, you can find a more inexpensive 1920x1080 display.
This will use non-integer scaling where some of the <quadplay/> pixels are 4 
display pixels wide and most are 5 pixels wide, or leave a black border
around the screen when using perfectly uniform 5x scaling.

The autoscaler will adjust to fill the screen unless the display resolution 
is very low or only slightly above an integer ratio, in which case it will favor
the integer ratio. Efficiency and scaling ratios when using <quadplay/>'s default 384x224
resolution are:

Screen     | Integer     | Used      | Efficiency  | Autoscaler | Used      | Efficiency
----------:|------------:|----------:|------------:|-----------:|----------:|---------:

### Buy

<quadplay/> works on all Mac, Windows, and Linux devices, so any
computer you buy can be a dedicated device for playing or making
games. For a _handheld_ form factor there are a few options.

We've tested on the Steam Deck, GPD Win 2, GPD Win Max, and GPD Win 3. All run
<quadplay/> well:

 - 1280x800 [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/), SteamOS/Linux in "Desktop" mode = full-res <quadplay/> 3x/3.33x scaling, 4x scaling of 320x180 <quadplay/>
 - 1280x800 [GPD Win Max](http://gpd.hk/gpdwinmax), Windows and Linux = full-res <quadplay/> 3x integer or 3.33x scaling, 4x scaling of 320x180 <quadplay/>
 - 1280x720 [GPD Win 3](https://www.gpd.hk/gpdwin3) and [GPD Win 2](http://gpd.hk/gdpwin2), Windows and Linux = full-res <quadplay/> 3x/3.33x scaling, 4x scaling of 320x180 <quadplay/>

![Quadplay running on Steam Deck under Firefox in Desktop mode with no installation.](steamdeck.jpg  style="image-rendering:none" width=50%)


Some other physical handhelds that may be capable of running <quadplay/>
games include:

Mobile Development
=====================================================

The quadplay IDE allows you to easily test your game on a mobile device while 
developing from a laptop or desktop computer. 

First, launch the `quadplay` script on your computer with the `--serve` flag. For example, 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
quadplay --serve games/quadpaddle/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Use your own game, not the `quadpaddle` sample, of course).

Second, in the web browser that opens on your computer, select the Project or Test
view at the upper right. Click on the Mobile tab of the debugging pane on the lower
right:

![The QR code in the Host tab of the IDE](mobile-tab.png)

Third, _on your mobile device_, either scan the QR code and then open the URL
it shows in a browser, or manually type the URL into your mobile browser.

Your mobile device will now play the game direct from your computer. You can edit
the game or assets on your computer and reload the browser page on your mobile
device to see the changes. You do not need to re-scan the QR code for each change.

!!! note Mobile Controls
    On a mobile device, quadplay games be played with
    the on-screen touch controls or a physical game controller paired over
    BlueTooth or plugged in directly over USB.


Deploying Games
====================================================================================

Your games can be played on any major web browser on desktop/laptop,
phone, tablet, or embedded processor such as Raspberry Pi. You can
also distribute them as phone or desktop apps. You may charge money
for your games and may distribute them as closed source.

It is your responsibility to satisfy copyright law and any licensing
fees or royalties for content that you use when you distribute your
game. The content provided with <quadplay/> is all royalty-free Creative Commons
and contains its own licensing data. Content that you find elsewhere
will have its own rules and restrictions. The code provided with
<quadplay/> is all Open Source (even though it permits you to use it with your
own closed-source came). See the Credits section for more information.


itch.io
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deploying to [itch.io](https://itch.io/) as a Browser Game allows you
to create a self contained online game that others can buy from you,
or play for free if you choose.

The steps are:

1. Select Game &gt; Export... from the menu in the IDE to produce a zipfile. 
   _You can also run the command line script `tools/export.py`_
   
2. [Click here](https://itch.io/game/new target="_blank") and in the tab that opens, enter the following settings:
  - Title: _your game name_
  - Project URL: _your game name_
  - Classification: Games
  - Kind of project: HTML
  - Embed Options:
     - How should your project be run in your page?: Embed in page, Manually set size
     - Mobile friendly: Yes
        - Orientation: Landscape
     - Automatically start on page load
  - Viewport: 770 x 474 (this will yield 2x scaling on most devices)
  - Visibility & Access: Public

  3. In the Uploads section on the itch.io game page, upload the zipfile generated in step 1.

  4. Check "This file will be played in the browser"

To update your game or upgrade the underlying <quadplay/> distribution,
repeat the process of creating the zipfile and then upload it as a
replacement for the original file.

![](itch.png style="image-rendering:none" width=50%)


GitHub
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using GitHub as a web host

1. Create a repository
  1. Go to https://github.com and sign in
  2. Click the + icon in the top right corner and select New repository
  3. Select Public (GitHub requires a public repository for free hosting)
  4. Click Create repository.
2. Configure GitHub Pages:
  1. Click on the Settings tab.
  2. In the left sidebar, click on Pages.
  3. Under "Build and deployment" for "Source", select Deploy from a branch.
  4. For "Branch", choose your primary branch (usually main or master) and ensure the folder is set to / (root).
  5. Click Save.
3. Export your game via Game &gt; Export... from the menu in the IDE. 
4. Upload your game.
  1. Extract the contents of the zipfile that you just produced
  2. In your web browser, go to the Code tab of your repository on GitHub
  3. Click on Add file, then select Upload files from the dropdown menu
  4. Upload the contents of the zipfile (not the zipfile itself)
  5. Click the green Commit changes button
  6. In a few minutes, your site will appear at the URL `https://yourusername.github.io/yourreponame/` (note that this is github.<b>io</b>, not <b>github.com</b>)

If you are experienced with another git GUI tool or the git command line, you can of course
use those tools instead of the web interface to git. In that case, you may prefer to automate
the export process using the command line <quadplay/> `tools/export.py` script as well.


### Combined develop and deployment repo

Use this method develop your game directly in a git repo and have it continuously
shared online from the main branch of your repo. *It does not require exporting.*

Store your game in a git repository on [github.com](https://github.com), or in
a subdirectory of a GitHub repository.  Do not fork quadplay into the repo
because that will make it large and disrupt the user's saved per-console state.
Just keep your game there in the repo by itself as you create it.

Assume that your GitHub account is named `USER` and your repo is named `REPO`.

To deploy, go to the settings page for your repo on GitHub. For example,
`https://github.com/USER/REPO/settings`. In the section titled "GitHub Pages"
on the settings page, select "main" from the Source section dropdown.

The URL to play your game is then:

`https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html?game=https://USER.github.io/REPO&mode=Maximal`.

If you'd like to make a friendlier URL, then you can also create an `index.html` file
in the root of your repo with the contents:

(embed github-example.txt here)

People visiting the URL `https://USER.github.io/REPO` will then be redirected to the correct page.


Web Server
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Standalone
You can host your game using only your own files on any web server that supports
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), or as a copy
of all of <quadplay/> on _any_ web server, regardless of whether it supports CORS.

To deploy your game on a web server with CORS named `myserver.com` in the `mygame`
directory, just use Game &gt; Export... from the IDE and upload the _contents_ of the
generated zipfile to your server.

Your URL will be just https://myserver.com/mygame for the directory containing
the `index.html` file.

### Minimal
If you wish to only host the source files for your game and not all of quadplay,
then you can do so. The URL for your game is:

https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html?game=https://myserver.com/mygame


Phones
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any <quadplay/> game hosted on a web page using the methods from the previous sections
can be played on a mobile phone. The emulator automatically creates on-screen buttons
when it detects a phone, and it also supports gamepads connected to a phone.

You can also deploy your game through a phone app store in order to sell it. This is
an advanced process. You must wrap your game with a binary program.
[Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) is a free tool that you can use to automate
this process. It requires familiarity with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), web apps,
the app store that you are deploying on, and the tools needed (such as Xcode for iOS)
to compile on the platform.

The basic idea is to use the method described in the itch.io section to create a
standalone web app, and then use Cordova to create the phone app.


Desktop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is a tool that turns web apps into desktop binary
projects which can be distributed through the Windows or Mac App stores, Steam, the
Epic Store, etc. It works by bundling an entire web browser with your application, wrapped
so that it looks like a native app. The process is similar to that of using Cordova.



Performance
====================================================================================

<quadplay/> is designed to make it easy to write small games that have
very readable source code. I recommend designing your code primarily
for readability instead of performance. However, at some point you'll
probably hit the performance limits and want to optimize at least some
of the program. Here's where to focus your efforts.

The emulator is fastest in Full Screen or Touch Screen mode. This
eliminates the extra IDE content and avoids several milliseconds per
frame of updates required for those.

To avoid input lag, process game pad input _before_ rendering and
simulation each frame. This allows the players' input to affect the
current frame instead of being delayed one frame. Game pads (and browsers)
have 1-2 frames of input lag in them. To conceal this, allow critical input
such as a jump, block, or dodge to happen up to one or two frames _after_
the period in which it should have. For example, do not damage the player
character until one frame after they are attacked and allow a late dodge
or block to save them retroactively.

In the "Performance" tab of the IDE, you can see the amount of time
spent per frame. If time spent is less than 16 ms, then your program
is running at 60 fps. If time spent is higher than 16 ms, then you may
need to optimize.

`draw_map()` is substantially faster than making the same
`draw_sprite()` calls by yourself. It culls all off-screen
sprites. Drawing a map with `camera.zoom = 1` or `z_scale = 0` is faster than
with perspective and zoom. Tiles without alpha will cull everything
behind them when not using perspective, so you don't have to leave out
the hidden map tiles for performance when drawing maps. Maps with
opaque tiles that are not rotated or scaled draw extremely fast.

`draw_map_span()` is substantially faster than your own 
per-pixel rendering using `get_map_pixel_color()` and `draw_point()`.
It is fastest when using opaque map tiles, a single layer of a map, and
no override color. The Kart example program intentionally uses a slower 
case as a stress test.

Built-in math functions are faster than math functions that you write
to do equivalent operations because they are designed to minimize
memory allocation internally. The intrinsics are maximum speed
but can make code hard to read.

There is generally no need to cull objects that are off screen. The
rendering code is very good at removing those for you.

`draw_sprite()` and `draw_map()` are fastest for `opacity=1` sprites that are not rotated
or scaled and do not have alpha. It can directly copy the memory in
this case.

It can be substantially faster (but use more memory)
to use pre-drawn transitions between map terrain tiles instead of layering
an alpha-masked tile on top of another one to blend them.

If you can tell that an object is covered by another object in `z`,
remove it (this is called occlusion culling). The renderer must
process both otherwise even though the object that is behind is
unseen.

All of the drawing calls are much faster for opaque colors than ones with
fractional alpha values.

Perfectly horizontal lines are much faster to draw than vertical lines.
Vertical lines are slightly faster than diagonal lines.

Sequential `draw_point()` calls that have the same `z` value are
significantly optimized in order to enable efficient per-pixel graphics.

Sequential `draw_sprite()` calls that have the same `z` value and
the same clipping region are slightly optimized to enable efficient custom
map rendering and particle systems.

Numeric for loops, such as `for i < N` are slightly faster than
iterator for loops such as `for x in A`.

`with` statements are relatively slow, as are `for`-`with` loops on
large arrays.  Use them for readability on individual or small sets of
objects but not on large arrays or in loops that repeat many times.

It is slightly faster to perform math on individual elements than
vectors.  For example, `pos.x += vel.x; pos.y += vel.y` is slightly
faster than `pos += vel`. The tradeoff of expanding out math is
generally not worth the readability cost unless processing hundreds of
vectors. The performance advantage diminishes as the objects grow
larger. For example, `rgba` vectors or adding whole arrays to each
other have relatively less overhead than `xy` vectors.


The IDE is designed to collapse gracefully so that you can use an
external editor. Here's one useful layout:

![](external-editor.png width=50% style="image-rendering:auto")

The editor on the left is emacs running in a terminal. On the right is
the browser reduced to the <quadplay/> debugging output and emulator.

Be careful to always end your *filenames* with _two_ extensions:
`.game.json`, `.sprite.json`, `.map.json`, etc. This is how the IDE
and compiler knows what type it is loading.

Take note of the 4-bit sprite
[quantizing tool](../tools/quantize.html). I find it better than the
quality produced by Photoshop for color reduction.


Safety and Security
====================================================================================

A <quadplay/> game cannot do anything that would let you access external content as 
a safety and security measure. 

For example, you are guaranteed that quadplay launched
in kiosk mode from the command line or via a kiosk link on the web cannot load anything
except quadplay games from the same web domain (which is usually your local computer).
This means you can put a quadplay installation in a school or conference public area,
or leave kids with it in your house, and know that they're only seeing the content
you chose. It also means that you can be confident running any quadplay game from anyone
that it cannot compromise your computer's security or trick you into doing something
like signing into a bank account.

The built-in games for <quadplay/> today are roughly equivalent to "E for everyone"
ESRB rated games. It is possible this may change in the future to include more 
"teen" rated games, but the distribution will never contain anything that would be
considered "mature" content with explicit language, graphic sexual content, or
realistic depictions of violence. (You can make and distribute your own <quadplay/> games with 
whatever content you choose, of course--I just won't include ones that aren't 
appropriate for all audiences in the core distribution.)

It is possible through some contortions to make a game that communicates arbitrary
text with other players on the internet. Since <quadplay/> intentionally has no video,
audio, or text chat capability this is not possible with the base distribution of
<quadplay/> games. However, someone could make and host their own game on their own server
to do this. So, players must use judgement when playing <quadplay/> games that are
outside of the distribution.

For games that include text, game developers should use the two provided dictionaries
of offensive and sensitive words to mask out content that should not be widely shared.
These are keyword based and therefore subject to attacks via misspellings and
spelling variants. The dictionaries are available at `quad://data/english_offensive.json`
and `quad://data/english_sensitive.json`. There is currently no support for languages
beyond English but games can provide their own dictionaries.


Vision
====================================================================================

The <quadplay/> API is stable, and many people are using it to make
hobby games, participate in game jams, and to learn/teach programming.

The soul of <quadplay/> as a console is described by:

- Up to four players with a shared screen
- Minimal time from launch to main play
- 1992 output limitations, 2025 development power

The overarching design principles of the quadplay IDE and language are:

- *Make small game development friendly and fun*
- Limitations that:
   - Allow games to run effectively on a wide range of displays,
     processors, and input devices without any per-platform work
   - Focus developers on gameplay and innovation
   - Help developers prevent scope creep
- Allow developers to bypass limitations to customize for a specific
  platform or game
- Support working wherever developers choose:
   - Entirely in a browser
   - Primarily in external tools
   - Or any combination!

Notes for Beta Testers
=====================================================================================

The IDE will receive major new features throughout and after the beta
phase. This includes editors for sprites and maps.

The private view online multiplayer mode is very new and has several
known limitations and bugs:

- There is no way to send audio to only some of the players
- Some of the system menus do not work in private screen mode 
  (credits, controls menu, set controls menu, set controller order)
- Only 384x224 and 128x128 screen resolution are supported (192x112 or 64x64 per player)

Expect rasterization alignment rules for triangles to change slightly
in order to better align for subpixel cases. The current map, disk,
line, and rectangle rendering alignment is final. Sprite alignment is
final but has a known 1/2 pixel bug that only manifests under rotation
and scaling. I will add separate functions for watertight triangle and
line rasterization, which give different results than what is
typically useful for individual primitives.

The `make_spline()` function using `"continue"` mode will change to be a
third-order curve outside of the bounds instead of a line.

The package manager is not implemented and may actually be removed
instead of being implemented, depending on the needs that arise in the
beta. You can load relative URLs for scripts and assets right now. So,
the need for packages isn't urgent as you can reuse across projects
already. What packages will provide are namespaces as well as assets
bundled together with a script.
